Buffett, 94, spent more than six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, which was Apple’s largest institutional shareholder until last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared a photo of himself and Buffett smiling together at Apple Park, along with a personal tribute to the legendary investor. “There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,” Cook wrote. “It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.” Buffett’s backing of Apple has been one of the most influential investments of his career—but it didn’t start that way. For years, he avoided Apple and other tech stocks,citing their unpredictabilityand his rule to “never invest in a business you cannot understand.” There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom. It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.pic.twitter.com/7p5zXtq5hP “We held very few in the past and we’re likely to hold very few in the future,” he said in 2012. “Coca-Cola is very easy for me to come to a conclusion as to what it will look like economically in five or 10 years, and it’s not easy for me to come to a conclusion about Apple.” That changed in 2016, when Berkshire Hathawaybegan buying Apple stock, eventually becoming its largest institutional shareholder. Buffett came to see Apple not as a traditional tech company, but as a consumer business with unmatched brand loyalty and recurring revenue. His long-term commitment helped legitimize Apple among value investors and reinforced its status as a cornerstone of the global economy. Although Berkshire has reduced its Apple stake, the firm still holds roughly $75 billion in AAPL shares. The Vanguard Group overtook Berkshire in 2024 to become Apple’s largest institutional shareholder, with a reported 9% stake. Berkshiretrimmednearly two-thirds of its Apple holdings last year, helping drive its record cash reserves past $300 billion. Buffett’s successor, 62-year-old Greg Abel, will assume the CEO role at the end of the year. Theannouncementcame during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting—an event that, six years ago, gave rise toWarren Buffett’s Paper Wizard, a whimsical iOS game released in partnership with Apple.

We recently published a list of10 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to billionaires. The latest market data shows that the US economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025. This was a rapid reversal from the 2.4% growth in the last quarter of 2024. The further segregation of the data shows that tariff uncertainty was one of the key contributing factors toward the slowdown, as net exports dropped 4.8%. According to a recent report by CNBC, traders highlighted that the imports were skewed up 41% last quarter as a preparatory move by companies to get ahead of the tariff situation. In this backdrop, the NASDAQ slipped another 0.09% on May 1, to end at 17,446.34. On April 30, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joined CNBC to talk about the outlook of the stock market amidst the tariff situation. He noted that the stock market is currently trying to figure out the trajectory of the economy as it is clear that the economic data for the next 3 quarters will be polluted by the tariffs and other distortions that follow. Lee highlighted that there are two questions that the market is trying to figure out. The first question is whether this is a dip and noise for 2025 only and the market exists in better shape as 2026 approaches. If this is the case then Lee believes that Equities have already made their lows with the S&P 500 at 4,835 on April 7. This will be the better-case scenario of all the possible outcomes. However, if the market feels that the uncertainty is dragging into a few more quarters in 2025 then that could be harmful for the stock market. CNBC’s Steve Liesman added to Tom Lee’s comments by mentioning that the current stock market is the President’s market. He highlighted that when President Trump took charge the stock market rallied, however, the later policies hampered the sentiment and took the stock market down with it. Liseman further elaborated that before all these policy uncertainties the forecasts for GDP in 2025 were at 2% growth each quarter. However, now the first quarter ended up at -0.3% with an expectation of 1.6% growth next quarter. Liseman concluded that the market might see the economy bouncing back in the next quarter allowing investors to make sense of the outlook. Amidst this uncertainty, Lee has emphasized the importance of staying invested in times of volatility to reap the benefits. We have covered more analysis from Tom Lee in10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. To curate the list of the 10 best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to billionaires, we used the Finviz stock screener and Insider Monkey’s billionaire database.

We have also added the total value of billionaire holdings and the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The analyst noted that the company is anticipated to grow its revenue by 4% year-over-year during the March and June quarters. Sankar highlighted that despite the tariff situation, the demand for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products has increased in the United States. Moreover, the services segment of the company is also anticipated to grow by 11% year-over-year. While the tariffs might hamper the iPhone unit sales in China, however, there is a significant upside in the United States, driven by the inventory build-up. In addition, the analyst also likes the company’s strategy to ramp up production in India, ahead of smartphone tariffs. Apple Inc.

Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after the company reported mixed first-quarter 2025 (fiscal Q2) results, which narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations, amid tariff concerns. CEO Tim Cook stated during the earnings call that anticipated tariffs could cost the company around $900 million in the current quarter (about 1% of total revenue). Also, sales in China saw a decline of 2%. This is a crucial market for Apple, and any signs of weakness there are usually viewed negatively. Overall, this print was decent, but the areas below expectations seem to be driving the move. The shares closed the day at $205.25, down 3.6% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple?Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Apple’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 23 days ago when the stock gained 4.8% as markets rallied sharply on news that President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. Reciprocal tariffs were also dropped to 10% for most countries, sparking renewed optimism amid ongoing trade talks. The major stock indices rose as investors, growing impatient of seemingly irrational tariff actions, welcomed the pause as a sign of a more measured path forward. However, Trump was quick to note that China was not part of the pause. Instead, he prepared to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US imports. This tough stance on China stood in sharp contrast to the softer tone toward others. In a week marked by growing uncertainty, this news eased some of the pressure. The questions remain whether we are out of the woods and can sustain the rally or not. Apple is down 15.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $205.45 per share, it is trading 20.7% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,803. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Despite Apple beating expectations for the fifth straight quarter, investors were less focused on what the company just reported and more on what lies ahead: a turbulent macroeconomic horizon, slowing margins, anda looming $900 million tariff hit. The elephant in the earnings room wasn’t just softer services revenue or a continued sales slump in China. It was the growing threat of geopolitical fallout — particularly President Donald Trump’s escalating tariff regime, which is forcing Apple into a major supply chain reshuffle. But amid the rising uncertainty, Apple still showed why it’s built to weather global storms. The company reported $95.4 billion in revenue on Thursday after the bell — up 5% year-over-year — and earnings of $1.65 per share, up 8%, riding strong demand in the U.S. and parts of Asia. Those figures beat expectations of $94.2 billion in revenue and $1.60 EPS. Still, the glow was tempered. Services underdelivered, revenue from China remained in decline, and product margins slipped. And with what Wedbush analysts have dubbed the “tariff tornado” circling just ahead of Apple’s expected iPhone 17 launch, the path forward looks anything but simple. Apple stock was down about 3% in midday trading on Friday. The shares have fallen about 15% so far this year amid the broader selloff in tech stocks. Here’s what to know. The biggest concern for Apple is one that’s looming: tariffs. For the most part, the only thing analysts wanted to ask CEO Tim Cook about on the earnings call was the company’s tariff-related exposure. He said the company saw a “limited impact” from Trump’s levies in the second quarter — but things could get much worse in the third quarter. Apple, he said, could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs for next quarter — if current global tariff rates, policies, and applications remain the same. At the moment, there’s a 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Cook said Apple mitigated second-quarter costs by moving a large chunk of its supply chain to India, where 50% of iPhones for the U.S. are currently coming from. Cook said the majority of iPhones for the June quarter will continue to come from India. Vietnam, meanwhile, will be the country of origin for almost all of Apple’s iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods sold in the U.S. China will remain the primary country of origin for most non-U.S. product sales. This strategic pivot could minimize the tariffs’ impact, but analysts remain divided on just how effective the pivot away from China might be. Jefferies analysts estimated that if tariffs go up by 1 percentage point and Apple doesn’t raise product prices, its pre-tax profits for the year could fall by about 1.5 percentage points. Wedbush analysts, however, raised their price target on Apple stock, citing Apple’s apparent mastery over a highly complex supply chain shift. In a note, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives emphasized that Apple’s pivot to India and Vietnam gives the company enough runway to avoid major disruption ahead of the iPhone 17 launch in September, calling India the “life raft” of Apple’s global manufacturing strategy. Chinese tariffs weren’t the only China-related headwind Apple saw: Revenue in the country continued to decline, by 2% in the second quarter. However, it was a marked improvement from the previous quarter, which saw a substantial 11% drop. The takeaway: A 2% decline isn’t great, but it could have been much worse. This stabilization was partly driven by Chinese government subsidies for consumer electronics, which helped support demand for devices such as the iPhone 16e and the newest iPad Air. Jefferies noted these subsidies likely cushioned Apple’s revenue slide in China, especially as the recent iPhone 16e targeted price-sensitive buyers. Cook pointed out that, when factoring out the foreign exchange headwinds, Apple’s revenue in the country was effectively flat. While the Chinese market remains challenging, the worst may be behind Apple in the region. Still, Chinese nationalism and consumer preferences for locally made devices remain key risks, especially with the heightened geopolitical tensions. For years, the Services segment — which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, AppleCare — has been Apple’s crown jewel. But in the second quarter, that glow dimmed, if only slightly. Services revenue still achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared with the previous year, despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. But that was below Wall Street’s expectations. Revenue came in at $26.6 billion, below the $26.7 billion analysts anticipated. Partially as a result of those lackluster figures, Apple stock dipped in after-hours trading on Thursday and continued to slump Friday. Jefferies noted that Services drove 60% of Apple’s total revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by a record-high gross margin of 75.7%. That strength offset weaker hardware margins. But concerns persist. Behind the scenes, several headwinds were at play. Regulatory scrutiny of the App Store’s fees had begun to impact margins. Subscription fatigue was spreading, as consumers reconsidered monthly commitments in the face of global economic pressures. And Apple’s push into original content and sports streaming, while strategic, hadn’t yet yielded blockbuster financial returns. “We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially, however, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis,” Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said. “With respect to Services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren’t providing the category level of color today.” For now, the golden goose is still laying eggs — but they’re leading some to wonder if they’re as golden as they used to be. Apple’s second-quarter earnings were buoyed by American consumers rushing to buy Apple products before Trump’s far-reaching tariffs could really take hold. The company also released the iPhone 16e during its second quarter, a lower-end phone that comes with limited AI features. On the whole, Apple beat expectations across much of its hardware department, reporting iPhone revenue of $46.84 billion (versus $45.84 billion estimated), Mac revenue of $7.95 billion (versus $7.77 billion estimated), and iPad revenue of $6.4 billion (versus $6.20 billion estimated). CFO Parekh cited a Kantar study that said, during the March quarter, the iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and Japan. He added, “We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97%, as measured by 451 Research.” But Jeffries analysts noted that iPhone gross margins fell by 1 percentage point year over year to 38.3%, the lowest in the past five years for a March quarter. Overall product gross margin dropped 0.7 percentage point to below 36%, also the lowest number for a March quarter in the past five years. Parekh attributed the margin compression to mix, foreign exchange, and a seasonal loss of leverage,” but Jefferies believes “faster builds and speedy March shipments” may also be to blame. Cook said he “strongly disagrees with” a judge’s antitrust ruling that Apple had violated a previous injunction related to its App Store policies. A California District Court ruled against Apple in its continuing litigation with Epic Games, ordering Apple to allow developers to link to external payment systems — an injunction that could hit App Store commission revenues. “We’ve complied with the court’s order, and we’re gonna appeal,” Cook said. The European Commission is also investigating Apple’s practices around Apple Pay and third-party app distribution. Cook added that Apple’s antitrust lawsuit — and monopoly suits Google (GOOGL) is facing — cast a specter over the tech industry. Responding to a question on the earnings call about the mounting legal risk, Cook said, “We’re monitoring these closely, but as you point out, there’s risk associated with them and the the outcome is unclear.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

As Big Tech and other firms continue to grapple with the Trump administration’s shifting tariff policies, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s latest earnings call that tariffs could cost it $900 million this quarter. “For the June quarter, currently we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter,” Cook said Thursday afterthe company reported second-quarter earnings. “However... assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. “This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters,” he added, “as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter.” Apple expects to buy more than 19 billion chips from U.S. manufacturers this year and continue to shift manufacturing away from China to India, Cook said. For the June quarter, he said, “we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin, and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products also sold in the U.S.” However, China will continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of product sales outside the U.S.,Cook said on the earnings call. Cook said Apple will lean more on TSMC(TSM), which is expanding its Arizona operations to half a dozen plants. Apple’s quarterly earnings,reported Thursday, rose 8% from the prior year to $1.65 per share, exceeding expectations. The company’s stock was still down about 4% in Friday morning trading, reflecting investor concerns about escalating tariff costs and lower sales in China. Apple already makes 20%, or one in five, of its iPhones in India. It expects to import most of the iPhones for the U.S. from India by the end of next year.

On a year-over-year basis, industry employment has grown by 1.7% to 143,000 jobs. “Despite weak construction spending data for March and several economic headwinds, including high interest rates, tight lending standards, and trade policy uncertainty, backlog remains sufficiently elevated to keep industry employment growing for the time being,” Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said in a statement. The construction unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in April, while unemployment across all industries remained at 4.2%. “That said, April is likely the last month of economic data largely unaffected by tariffs and tariff-related uncertainty. The reference period for today’s jobs report is the pay period through April 12, which may exclude staffing decisions, or project cancellations or delays, related to recent trade policy developments. While the economic outlook has worsened in recent weeks, it remains unclear how the economy will respond in the coming months,” Basu added. Block (XYZ) shares fell sharply on Friday after the financial services and digital payments company cut its full-year gross profit outlook, which came in below the average analyst estimate. For the first quarter, the company behind Square and CashApp reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, well above analyst estimates of $0.47. However, revenue came in at around $5.7 billion, missing the forecast of $6.2 billion. Looking ahead, Block expects full-year adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion, representing a 19% gross margin, down from its prior guidance of $2.1 billion. It also expects a full-year gross profit of $9.96 billion, below the consensus estimate of $10.18 billion. The payments processor cited the economic uncertainty for its cautious outlook. “We recognize we are operating in a more dynamic macro environment, so we have reflected a more cautious stance on the macro outlook into our guidance for the rest of the year,” Blocksaid in its shareholder letter. Several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock, including Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Bauch, who changed his rating to Equal Weight from Overweight and lowered his price target to $50 from $95. Bauch stated that it is too difficult to recommend the shares at their current level, citing ""(1) a heavily back half weighted guide, (2) growing credit contributions and (3) numerous Cash App monetization red flags.” Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Readmore here.

AAPL,2025-05-01,Tariffs To Take a Bite Out of Apple's Results,"Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Trump administration’s tariffs, if they remain at their current levels, will cost Apple about $900 million in the current quarter...",Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/tariffs-to-take-a-bite-out-of-apple-results-11726830,"Cheng Xin / Getty Images Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook said the Trump administration’s tariffs, if they remain at their current levels, will cost Apple about $900 million in the current quarter that runs through June. During the company’squarterly earningscall Thursday, Cook said a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. this quarter will comefrom India, rather than China, with iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and other products coming mostly from Vietnam. The comments come amid concerns the company could be particularly hurt by trade tensions with China, where Apple manufactured an estimated 90% of its products until recently. Most Apple products areexemptfrom President Trump's 125%""reciprocal"" tariffson Chinese goods, but still affected by the 20% import tax the White House put in place earlier in the year to combat fentanyl trafficking, Cook noted. Cook also warned the impact of tariffs to Apple's results could change, given the company is “uncertain of potential future actions” the administration could take. Trump has said he expects tariffs on China“will come down substantially”in trade negotiations but not drop to zero.

AAPL,2025-05-01,Apple earnings beat expectation as Americans rush to buy iPhones before tariffs,Fiscal second-quarter earnings show that the Apple (AAPL) hasn’t lost its shine.,Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tops-wall-street-expectations-174900555.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Fiscal second-quarter earnings show that the Apple (AAPL) hasn’t lost its shine. Thursday after the bell, Apple reported $95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% year-over-year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year amid robust demand, even as geopolitics threaten its supply-chain wizardry. But while the company beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the fifth quarter in a row — exceeding estimates of $1.60 EPS and $94.2 billion in revenue — sales from its key services unit and from China disappointed. Apple’s second-quarter earnings were buoyed by American consumers rushing to buy Apple products before President Donald Trump’s far-reaching tariffs could really take hold. The company also released the iPhone 16e during its second quarter, a lower-end phone that comes with limited AI features. On the whole, Apple beat expectations across much of its hardware department, reporting iPhone revenue of $46.84 billion (versus $45.84 billion estimated), Mac revenue of $7.95 billion (versus $7.77 billion estimated), and iPad revenue of $6.4 billion (versus $6.20 billion estimated). Yet its services segment — which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and other recurring streams — just missed expectations, coming in at $26.65 billion, below the $26.70 billion analysts anticipated. Services revenue was still up 11.65% from a year ago. Apple’s stock slid more than 2% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Apple was among the hardest-hit tech giants due to its exposure to China, where it currently manufactures 90% of the iPhones it sells in the U.S. Almost every question during the company’s earnings call had to do with tariffs. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company saw “limited impact” from tariff-related effects this quarter, largely due to a temporary exemption for electronics. “We are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of this quarter,” he said. But, he added, if current global tariff rates remain the same, the financial impact could be significant next quarter: Apple could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs for the June quarter. President Donald Trump’s trade war has turned into a structural headwind for Apple’s global operations. To mitigate tariff risks, Apple is accelerating its shift away from China. Now, Cook said, most of Apple’s third-quarter iPhone sales will come from devices assembled in India, with other products increasingly produced in Vietnam. Apple sought to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs by shipping approximately $2 billion worth of iPhones from India to the U.S.; the company did so to maintain its inventory levels and stave off price hikes. ​ On the earnings call, Cook was also asked about a blockbuster antitrust ruling yesterday that said Apple violated an order to reform its App Store. Cook said the company “strongly disagrees” with the ruling and that it plans to appeal. For the latest news,Facebook,TwitterandInstagram."
AAPL,2025-05-01,Berkshire Hathaway earnings are coming. Here's what to watch,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) is gearing up to report its first-quarter earnings Friday.

And as usual, Wall Street will be paying close attention to what Warren Buffett says about the tumult in today’s markets and economy, as well as what the Oracle of Omaha’s crystal ball tells him about the future. The company’s stock has been on a tear, up 17% so far this year and outperforming the S&P 500. But with recession fears causing a possible slowdown in investment and with a growing focus on Berkshire’s line of succession, this quarter’s numbers could tell investors more than usual. Analysts are projecting adjusted first-quarter earnings per share of $4.72, according to TipRanks — a slight drop from the $5.20 posted in the first quarter of last year. Still, those expectations may very well be conservative: Berkshire has a habit of beating estimates. Of course, the holding company is heavily influenced by swings in its massive stock portfolio — where Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC) are still key drivers, meaning soft numbers could bring Berkshire back down to Earth. Berkshire’s portfolio holdings also include shares of Amazon (AMZN), Coca-Cola (KO), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Citigroup (C), Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Chevron(CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Beyond the investment portfolio, Berkshire’s core operating businesses — which include Geico, BNSF Railway, and MidAmerican Energy — are expected to deliver solid results. (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom are also under Berkshire’s umbrella.) Insurance, in particular, has the potential be a bright spot if underwriting profits continue to recover after large catastrophe losses in recent years. Meanwhile, Berkshire is sitting on a record-breaking cash pile north of $300 billion. That’s partly a product of discipline: Buffett has steered clear of overpriced deals in a frothy market. But it also raises the pressure. Investors want to know if Berkshire sees any buying opportunities on the horizon — especially now that valuations in some sectors are coming back to earth. We already know a little bit about where Berkshire is investing: SEC filings show Buffett invested $54 million into Sirius XM (SIRI) in February and bought Verisign (VRSN) and Occidental Petroleum shares for close to a combined $40 million. Berkshire also purchased five add-ons to the Japanese trading houses for an estimated $2.7 billion. Berkshire also sold just under $148 million worth of DaVita (DVA) to maintain ownership below 45%. Because of market weakness, some analysts expect that Buffett will add to Berkshire’s already massive stack of Treasury bills. But there’s a subplot here: succession. Buffett is 94, and while he shows no sign of slowing down, vice chairman Greg Abel has been named as his eventual successor. Abel has been running the non-insurance businesses and is expected to play a prominent role at the annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha — which could be the most-watched company meeting in years. With investors increasingly focused on what Berkshire looks like after Buffett, the company’s earnings report — and what’s said during Saturday’s shareholder session — could offer clues about how the company will be managed going forward and what kind of moves are happening behind the scenes. How exactly does a company replace someone who is believed to be as close to a god as the industry has? Abel’s increased visibility will be both a reassurance and a test: Can Berkshire maintain its identity — and its top-tier reputation — in a post-Buffett world? Add in the broader market’s volatility and questions about where Berkshire might deploy its record cash reserves, and this quarter’s earnings could carry more weight than usual. The bottom line: Berkshire has been a market stalwart in 2025, but Saturday’s report will need to back that up with solid fundamentals — and maybe a few hints about what comes next.

But Eli Lily's CEO isn't as concerned. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports: Eli Lilly (LLY) has enjoyed a successful run the past several quarters as the company's blockbuster GLP-1 weight-loss drug Wegovy gains steam in the obesity space. But Wall Street wiped out more than $90 billion in the company's market cap during trading Thursday after competitor Novo Nordisk (NVO) locked in a deal to have its GLP-1 listed on CVS's (CVS) formularyas the preferred weight-loss drugfor patients. But Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks waved off the deal Thursday, telling Yahoo Finance in an interview that the company is focused more on upcoming obesity drugs in its pipeline and sees exclusive deals as an older way of doing business. ""We're not interested in exclusive deals. We think innovation and choice is very important. And we're well into the product replacement cycle, and there's more coming,"" Ricks said, referring to the highly anticipated oral form of Eli Lilly's GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to hit the markets mid-next year.

Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates fell this week amid a period of relative stability for the bond market. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.76% this week through Wednesday, from 6.81% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.92%, compared with 5.94% last week. After several weeks of volatility, 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, are starting to move lower once again. They’re around 4.2% as of Thursday morning, from 4.31% a week ago. Mortgage rates have been on a bumpy path since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs in early April, but they’re settling now as markets await more information about the likely path of benchmark interest rates.

Microsoft (MSFT) was up over 8% while Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) were both more than 4% higher. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock dropped more than 8% after the chipmaker gave a slightly softer-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Qualcomm said it expected $10.3 billion in revenue at the midpoint for the current period (its fiscal third quarter), slightlylower than the $10.33 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data. ""There's uncertainty around the impact of the global trade landscape on demand across our businesses,"" said CFO Akash Palkhiwala in a call with analysts. ""Our guidance for the upcoming quarter is based on our current assessment of the financial impact of tariffs as they stand today."" On the other hand, Qualcomm's earnings and revenue for the March period (its fiscal second quarter) beat expectations. Citi analyst Chris Danely removed the chipmaker from the investment firm's ""catalyst"" list for stocks to watch, as the analyst said a smartphone upgrade cycle is ""at least a year away."" Qualcomm's chips are used in Android cell phones and Apple (AAPL) iPhones. Qualcomm's drop comes as other chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) surged Thursday following Meta (META) and Microsoft's (MSFT) reaffirmation of their billions in spending on AI infrastructure this year. Qualcomm makes ASIC accelerators (custom chips to run AI models faster, used in addition to GPUs such as Nvidia's) for data centers. Manufacturing activity fell further into contraction in April as the reality of President Trump's tariffs set in. TheInstitute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMIfell to an index reading of 48.7 in April, below the 49 seen the month prior. However, the reading was above the 47.9 economists had expected. Readings below 50 indicate contraction in the sector. The ISM's prices paid index for the sector came in at 69.8, roughly flat compared to the prior month. Meanwhile, new orders increased to a reading of 47.2, above the 45.2 seen in March. ""In April, U.S. manufacturing activity slipped marginally further into contraction after expanding only marginally in February,"" chair of the Institute for Supply Management Timothy Fiore said in the release. ""Demand and output weakened while input strengthened further, conditions that are not considered positive for economic growth."" Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 4.3% early Thursday, leading chip stocks higher after Big Tech leaders Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) reaffirmed their aggressive AI investment plans. Shares of fellow AI chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Nvidia supplier Micron (MU), which makes advanced memory chips for its GPUs (graphics processing units), climbed 2.7%. During its quarterly earnings presentations late Wednesday afternoon, Microsoftreiterated its $80 billion spending plan to build out AI data centers, with more than half of that spending going toward the US. Meta, meanwhile, raised its capital expenditure outlook for 2025, forecasting spending will now fall between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from its prior range of $60 billion to $65 billion.

AAPL,2025-05-01,Judge says CEO Tim Cook 'chose poorly' as Apple ignored App Store order,A US judge ordered Apple to immediately decrease its App Store fees and asked for criminal prosecutors to review the company's alleged 'cover-up...,Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-says-ceo-tim-cook-chose-poorly-as-apple-ignored-app-store-order-174755382.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. A US judge ordered Apple (AAPL) to immediately decrease its App Store fees and asked for criminal prosecutors to review the company's alleged ""cover-up,"" jeopardizing billions in revenue for the tech giant. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, in a blistering 80-page decision, said Apple circumvented her 2021 order that was first issued in an antitrustcasebrought by ""Fortnite"" developerEpic Games. Thatordersaid Apple must allow App Store developers to direct customers to app purchases outside the store. ""Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,"" wrote Gonzalez Rogers, a judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of California. She accused the tech giant's vice president of finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath during testimony before the court in February and referred the case to state criminal prosecutors to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings would be appropriate. Internally at Apple, the judge added, Apple fellow Phillip Schiller had advocated for Apple to comply with her 2021 injunction, but that was ignored by CEO Tim Cook. ""Cook chose poorly,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. Her mandate raises new questions about the financial impact on a major revenue stream for Apple as the tech giant prepares to report second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. The iPhone maker, which holds roughly19% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said in a court document that the App Store generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue. As of February 2025, the store hosted roughly 2 million downloadable apps. In 2024,accordingto Statista, the store earned nearly $92 billion globally, a 14% increase over 2023. The legal drama that unfolded this week started in August 2020, when Epic firstchallengedApple with a lawsuit. It was eventually decided in part in Apple's favor, finding that the company did not hold a monopoly in the market for ""digital mobile gaming transactions."" However, in a major victory for Epic — and app developers at large — the judge held that anti-steering provisions contained in the App Store's rules violated California's antitrust law. Essentially, Gonzalez Rogers' 2021 order said Apple must allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that can lead users to pay for in-app purchases outside the App Store. Epic and Apple appealed the decision to California's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with Gonzalez Rogers that Apple had not violated federal antitrust laws. Although the court reached that conclusion for distinct reasons, it upheld the injunction in April 2023, holding that the anti-steering provisions violated California's Unfair Competition Law. The US Supreme Courtdeclined to reviewthe case in January 2024. Apple did make changes to its App Store rules following the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case, but Epic argued that the changes didn't comply with the order. Apple maintained its 30% commission and 15% commission for small businesses for in-app purchases, and it implemented a new 27% commission for off-app purchases, where it previously had not levied charges. According to the court, the company also introduced a ""scare screen"" to dissuade customers from leaving the App Store. Apple's goal, Gonzalez Rogers wrote, was to ""maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream"" and ""impose new barriers"" for developers. ""Apple, despite knowing its obligations ... thwarted the injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct...."" Gonzalez Rogers said. ""Remarkably, Apple believed that this court would not see through its obvious cover-up."" Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X@alexiskweed.

AAPL,2025-05-01,"Apple earnings updates: Wall Street watching for trade-war impact, iPhone production",Apple's earnings call is today at 5 pm ET. AAPL stock heads into the report down 15% YTD. Analysts are focused on tariff impact on supply chains.,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-stock-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2025-5,"Applereported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the closing bell, and it answered tariff questions with a nearly billion-dollar answer. The tech giant told investors on a call that Donald Trump's tariff plans could cost Apple $900 million in the current quarter. Analysts, however, had a lot of follow-up queries for CEO Tim Cook about which levies are and aren't included in the estimate. On Apple's supply chain, Cook said the company expects the ""majority"" of iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter to be made in India, marking a shift away from its main hub in China thanks to tariffs. Cook also fielded questions about Apple's progress on its Apple Intelligence software and a personalized Siri. Although its AI is available in more languages, Apple needs ""more time"" to perfect Siri. While revenue — including from iPhones — and EPS beat estimates, sales from its key Services unit and from Greater China disappointed. Apple's stockslid more than 4% in volatile after-hours trading after the results. The company reported revenue for the period of $95.36 billion, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $94.59 billion. But service revenue came in at $26.65 billion, missing the forecast of $26.72 billion. Shares rose 0.4% ahead of the close on Wednesday, bringing the stock's year-to-date loss to 15% at the close. Unlike other tech companies this spring, Apple was willing to say the word ""tariff"" during its analyst call today. And more than just that: The company was willing to spell out the financial effects the looming Trump tariffs will have on its business: It projects that they will add $900 million in costs in the June quarter. OK. But what exactly does that mean? I'm not 100% sure, and analysts also seemed unclear, and followed up with multiple questions for CEO Tim Cook. What Cookseemedto suggest is that Apple thinks the $900 million number holds if: Got it? OK. But what does that $900 million mean for Apple and its consumers? Would Apple consider eating those costs, or passing them along to consumers? Cook wouldn't answer that one directly. It is worth noting $900 million just isn't that much money for Apple, which generated $24.8 billion in profits this quarter. If Apple had to swallow that cost for many quarters to come, there's a good chance Wall Street would be okay with that. But at the same time, Cook stressed that the $900 million figure he's presented for the next quarter may not be applicable for future quarters, for a variety of reasons. Crystal clear, right? — Peter Kafka ""We've delivered a lot,"" Cook says when asked about the status of the features it teased at WWDC last year. Cook emphasizes, once again, Apple's recent rollout of Apple Intelligence in more languages. On the updated Siri, it needs ""more time."" — Jordan Hart Tim was asked about how product prices might be impacted by tariffs and Cook didn't give much away. He said ""we're very engaged on the tariff discussions."" He said the company ""will continue to engage on the pricing piece,"" but the company has nothing to add about how product prices might be impacted today. He added that the operational team ""has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain of the inventory."" — Jordan Hart ""We don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs,"" Cook says. He added that its channel inventory at the start of the quarter was similar to that of the end. — Jordan Hart Cook says he expects the ""majority"" of iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter to be made in India. Vietnam, he says, will be the country of origin for almost all of its other products coming into the US. The rest of the world still relies on China. — Jordan Hart Apple estimates that the current tariff rates will cost the company $900 million this current quarter if nothing changes. ""We are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter,"" it said. — Jordan Hart Cook says Apple is still getting the AI-powered Siri ready for iPhone owners. ""We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high quality bar,"" Cook says Cook shouts out Apple's four-year $500 billion spending plan partly for expanding its teams and facilities in Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and more. ""We expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year,"" Cook says. — Jordan Hart In its standard investor call blurb, the company said: ""Our discussion today will consist of forward looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook,including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measuresand macro economic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast."" Link hereif you want to listen along too. — Jordan Hart As Trump ups tariffs on China, some consumers chose to get ahead of potential price increases by upgrading their phones immediately. However, Wall Street still wants to know Cook's plan for a turbulent trade environment, tech analyst Jacob Bourne said. Cook is expected to shed light on how tariffs will affect consumers, and if the answer to its challenges lies in a manufacturing shift to India.""This balancing act comes during a crucial time as Apple prepares for WWDC and its next product cycle, where pricing strategy will be a focal point amid economic and supply chain uncertainty,"" Bourne said. — Jordan Hart Products revenue: $68.71 billion, +2.7% y/y, estimate $67.84 billion Source: Bloomberg Apple stock rose 0.4% ahead of its earnings release on Thursday after the closing bell. TheS&P 500closed 0.6% higher, while the tech-heavyNasdaq Compositerose 1.5%. Stocks werebroadly higheron Thursday after strong earnings results fromMetaand Microsoft. Jefferies said Apple was likely to beat the firm's revenue growth estimate of 0.9% for the first quarter. Still, analysts saw risks to Apple's profit margins, due to potential challenges the company may face as it looks to expand its iPhone production in India. ""This makes sense if we believe US reciprocal tariff on India will be very low, or AAPL gets an exemption. However, this may not be realistic,"" analysts said, pointing to ""more complicated assembly"" of some of Apple's newer and upcoming products. ""Therefore, we still see cost/margin risk at AAPL."" Jefferies rates Apple at ""Hold"" with a $167 price target, implying 22% downside from Wednesday's intraday high price. Federal judgeYvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Apple was in ""willful violation""of a 2021 ruling she had made, andthat she would refer the company for a possible criminal prosecution. That's pretty newsworthy. But what about the rest of Rogers' ruling? Well, that could be pretty newsworthy, too. It'spossiblethat this could finally be the thing that fundamentally changes the way Apple operates its App Store — an increasingly key source of the company's revenues. Or, it might not. Let's review. — Peter Kafka Looming tariff risks for Apple are likely going to drive investor questions around its massive exposure to China's manufacturing industry, according to Anurag Rana, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Apple's sourcing strategy will likely remain the most discussed topic on its 2Q earnings call given the company's high dependency on China for both assembly and components,"" Rana said in a note last week. Rana said that while Apple's products have been exempted from Trump's tariff list, there is still a risk that those surcharges return. Bank of America reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on Apple, citing the company's resilient earnings, stable cash flow, and potential benefit from incorporating AI on its devices. Still, the company's earnings estimates for the current quarter could take a ""more severe"" hit due to tariffs, particularly if tensions between the US and China escalate, BofA analysts wrote. ""However, we note that Apple has many options to mitigate downside risk to estimates. These include: sourcing more iPhones from India, applying higher pricing in products/services, pressuring its supply chain for better economics, introducing new products at higher price points and changing cadence of product releases,"" the bank added. Analysts issued a $250 price target for the stock, implying a 17% upside from current levels. As Apple's biggest revenue driver, iPhone sales have always taken center stage during Apple's earnings, and the flagship product will be even more in focus this time around. Investors will look for clues about the success of thecheaper iPhone 16e handsetreleased in February. They'll also look for indications from the company about the role of its AI-focused services, bundled up as Apple Intelligence, in spurring interest in new devices. Apple has also had a harder time getting new iPhones into pockets in its most important international market, China, as domestic players like Huawei have tried to entice consumers with advanced phones rivaling the iPhone with an aggressive pricing strategy. iPhone pricing is a key focus at a time when China tariffs have raised concerns among analysts thathigher costscould be passed on to consumers. — Hasan Chowdhury Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said a pull-forward i"
AAPL,2025-05-01,Stock shrug off recession alarms as Big Tech earnings blow off the roof,"U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s ...",Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-shrug-off-recession-alarms-122300844.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’scloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA)reporteda solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadowWednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations.Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share.Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increaseon 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowlyrejecteda bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greersaidthere are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’smissedearnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes.

Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’scloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA)reporteda solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb(ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadowWednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations.Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share.Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increaseon 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowlyrejecteda bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greersaidthere are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’smissedearnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes.

It currently has a market size of $42.48 billion as of 2024. While the largest market for the industry is North America, the Asia Pacific region is anticipated to be the fastest growing. The report also highlighted that a significant portion of this market is mobile AR, which leverages the globally spread use of smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices. Some estimates show that nearly 1.7 billion devices can support mobile AR as of 2024. Therefore, the massive and globally spread smartphone user base gives the AR industry a key competitive advantage.

The Immersive Entertainment—Global Strategic Business Report 2024 showed that the global market for Immersive Entertainment was $133.6 billion in 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23.5% between 2024 and 2030, reaching $473.9 billion at the end of the forecast period. Thus, the global AR market is also likely to benefit from the expansion of the immersive entertainment industry. The AR market is yet to reach the apex of its potential, and experts estimate that it will do so in about a decade. Many technological advancements in the industry support this growth, as tech giants have been scrambling to attain the AR and mixed reality dream for years. Investments worth billions of dollars have been directed to the cause. According to SkyQuest, the largest investment is being poured into training and industrial maintenance, with figures reaching as much as $4.1 billion in the field of AR. Apart from this, private firms, VCs, and even some governments are financing AR research institutes and teams. The augmented reality industry has a primary user base comprising healthcare, aerospace and defense, consumer, and retail. In addition, the technology is being increasingly used in the automotive industry. Since autonomous vehicles are becoming a rising trend across the globe, the integration of AR in these vehicles is supporting the broader AR industry. AR technology helps improve the driver and the autonomous system’s comprehension of their environment by overlaying digital data in the real world. In addition to several other features, consumers can interact with virtual 3D models of vehicles with the help of AR technology in showrooms, allowing them to visualize several customizations. Another key growth driver for the industry is the use of AR in hospitals and medical startups. The healthcare sector continuously uses immersive modalities to streamline its processes, as surgeons are increasingly leveraging AR to deal with the potential risks of healthcare procedures. AR is helping healthcare professionals reduce the rate of errors and the number of potentially unsafe surgeries. According to SkyQuest, the AR segment in the healthcare industry was expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2024. With these positive future trends for the AR industry in view, let’s look at the 11 best augmented reality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 25 stocks operating in the AR space and chose the top 11 with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Our focus was on companies producing AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used to develop augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The Nasdaq rose on Thursday as investors put aside uncertainty over President Trump's tariff policy and instead focused on optimism over Big Tech's AI prospects. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6% to extend its longest win streak of the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.5%, but off the highs of the session on the heels of better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also extended its longest winning streak of the year to gain 0.2%. Investors awaited tech earnings fromApple(AAPL) andAmazon(AMZN) set to report right after the bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Amazon (AMZN) stock jumped 3% on Thursday ahead of its first quarter earnings report, where investors are expected to press the company on how upcoming tariffs might impact its business. For the quarter, Amazon is expected to see earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36 and revenue of $155.1 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. That’s a jump from the EPS of $0.98 and revenue of $143.3 billion the company reported in Q1 last year. Read more here. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares were down nearly 10% as investors reacted to CVS (CVS) naming Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1 drug Wegovy as a preferred drug on its formulary. But Eli Lily's CEO isn't as concerned. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports: Eli Lilly (LLY) has enjoyed a successful run the past several quarters as the company's blockbuster GLP-1 weight-loss drug Wegovy gains steam in the obesity space. But Wall Street wiped out more than $90 billion in the company's market cap during trading Thursday after competitor Novo Nordisk (NVO) locked in a deal to have its GLP-1 listed on CVS's (CVS) formularyas the preferred weight-loss drugfor patients. But Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks waved off the deal Thursday, telling Yahoo Finance in an interview that the company is focused more on upcoming obesity drugs in its pipeline and sees exclusive deals as an older way of doing business. ""We're not interested in exclusive deals. We think innovation and choice is very important. And we're well into the product replacement cycle, and there's more coming,"" Ricks said, referring to the highly anticipated oral form of Eli Lilly's GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to hit the markets mid-next year. ""It's in some ways a little disappointing to see this. It feels a little bit like last decade, these sort of lock-up deals,"" Ricks added. Read more here.

Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates fell this week amid a period of relative stability for the bond market. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.76% this week through Wednesday, from 6.81% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.92%, compared with 5.94% last week. After several weeks of volatility, 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, are starting to move lower once again. They’re around 4.2% as of Thursday morning, from 4.31% a week ago. Mortgage rates have been on a bumpy path since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs in early April, but they’re settling now as markets await more information about the likely path of benchmark interest rates. Read more here. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up as much as 2.4% on Thursday morning, and it is mainly megacap technology leading the index higher. Microsoft (MSFT) was up over 8% while Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) were both more than 4% higher. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock dropped more than 8% after the chipmaker gave a slightly softer-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Qualcomm said it expected $10.3 billion in revenue at the midpoint for the current period (its fiscal third quarter), slightlylower than the $10.33 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data. ""There's uncertainty around the impact of the global trade landscape on demand across our businesses,"" said CFO Akash Palkhiwala in a call with analysts. ""Our guidance for the upcoming quarter is based on our current assessment of the financial impact of tariffs as they stand today."" On the other hand, Qualcomm's earnings and revenue for the March period (its fiscal second quarter) beat expectations. Citi analyst Chris Danely removed the chipmaker from the investment firm's ""catalyst"" list for stocks to watch, as the analyst said a smartphone upgrade cycle is ""at least a year away."" Qualcomm's chips are used in Android cell phones and Apple (AAPL) iPhones. Qualcomm's drop comes as other chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) surged Thursday following Meta (META) and Microsoft's (MSFT) reaffirmation of their billions in spending on AI infrastructure this year. Qualcomm makes ASIC accelerators (custom chips to run AI models faster, used in addition to GPUs such as Nvidia's) for data centers. Manufacturing activity fell further into contraction in April as the reality of President Trump's tariffs set in. TheInstitute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMIfell to an index reading of 48.7 in April, below the 49 seen the month prior. However, the reading was above the 47.9 economists had expected. Readings below 50 indicate contraction in the sector. The ISM's prices paid index for the sector came in at 69.8, roughly flat compared to the prior month. Meanwhile, new orders increased to a reading of 47.2, above the 45.2 seen in March. ""In April, U.S. manufacturing activity slipped marginally further into contraction after expanding only marginally in February,"" chair of the Institute for Supply Management Timothy Fiore said in the release. ""Demand and output weakened while input strengthened further, conditions that are not considered positive for economic growth."" Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 4.3% early Thursday, leading chip stocks higher after Big Tech leaders Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) reaffirmed their aggressive AI investment plans. Shares of fellow AI chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Nvidia supplier Micron (MU), which makes advanced memory chips for its GPUs (graphics processing units), climbed 2.7%. During its quarterly earnings presentations late Wednesday afternoon, Microsoftreiterated its $80 billion spending plan to build out AI data centers, with more than half of that spending going toward the US. Meta, meanwhile, raised its capital expenditure outlook for 2025, forecasting spending will now fall between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from its prior range of $60 billion to $65 billion. Meta stock rose 6% Thursday morning, while Microsoft jumped 10%. Read the full story here. The largest stock in the world is ripping higher on Thursday morning.

AAPL,2025-04-30,Google CEO warns judge a breakup of search empire 'will have many unintended consequences',Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai took the witness stand Wednesday at the company's breakup trial in an attempt to preserve the competitive advantages of a crown...,Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-ceo-warns-judge-a-breakup-of-search-empire-will-have-many-unintended-consequences-182533297.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai took the witness stand Wednesday at his company's breakup trial in an attempt to preserve the competitive advantages of a crown jewel: Google Search. Pichai said government proposals to break up the company, end its exclusive distribution agreements, and force it to share decades of search engine data would provide an inapt way to spur competition. ""It will have many unintended consequences,"" Pichai said,accordingto Bloomberg. Pichai's testimony unfolded in the Washington, D.C., federal district court where Google went to trial in 2023 against the US Justice Department. Last August, US District Judge Amit Mehta found Google liable for illegally monopolizing the general search engine market and the market for general search engine text. Mehta is now tasked with weighing testimony from Pichai and others in the ""remedies"" phase of the landmark case before ordering a fix for the monopoly while also balancing advances in artificial intelligence that are forcing an evolution of the traditional online search market. Pichai described the government's suggested remedies as ""far-reaching"" and ""extraordinary,""accordingto reports. The proposals, he added, would make it ""unviable"" for Google to continue the level of research and development investments in search that it has made for the past 30 years. The CEO testified that one of the government's requests for a judge to order Google to sell off its Chrome browser felt like a ""de facto divestiture of search"" along with the intellectual property that Google developed for more than two decades. Federal prosecutors view Google's unsurpassed level of search data amassed through its search monopoly as a threat to emerging search products that rely on AI. Google is trying to persuade Mehta that he should reject the DOJ's proposals to restore competition by forcing it to sell its overwhelmingly dominant Chrome browser and by limiting its use of AI tools to enhance its existing search products. The DOJ is also asking the judge to block Google from agreements that place Google Search in a default position on internet-connected devices. The government has said it may also seek a forced divestiture of Google's Android operating system. The search case is one of two ongoing antitrust litigations initiated by the federal government. In a second antitrust case also in the remedies stage of trial, a federal judge found Google liable for illegally monopolizing two online advertising technology markets. Prosecutors allege in the search trial that Google unfairly reinforced the quality of its search business by entering into contracts with powerful search distributors, including Apple (AAPL), that secured Google as their default search engine. In 2021, Googlepaid $26 billionfor default search placements. The lion's share went to Apple, which Bernstein analysts have estimated totals somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. Google has maintained that its default placement contracts are good for competition and consumers and that the company legally gained its overwhelming dominance in search by offering superior-quality searches compared to its peers. Pichai testified that Google is working on similar agreements with Apple that would place Google's next-generation search chatbot, Gemini AI, on iPhones. At trial in October 2023, Pichai testified that the multibillion-dollar default search engine contracts with companies like Apple, Samsung, and Mozilla were pro-competitive. Google has said that a Chrome divestment and a requirement to share data with unknown foreign and domestic entities would create personal privacy and national security risks for its users. The software ecosystem that integrates Gmail, Search, Chrome, and Google Cloud, the company has argued, allows it to survey and detect malicious threats. The remedies phase is scheduled to run until May 9. No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

AAPL,2025-04-30,Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks For Beginners?,"We recently published a list of 12 Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks For Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc...",Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-among-best-091638737.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. We recently published a list of12 Best Warren Buffett Stock Picks For Beginners.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best Warren Buffett stocks to invest in. Warren Buffett, one of the most renowned names in the world of finance, was inspired by two famous economists from the 1930s, Ben Graham and Philip Fisher. From Graham, Buffett learned the idea of a margin of safety, which means he seeks companies whose stocks are trading for less than what their assets are actually worth. He also picked up Graham’s belief that it is pointless to obsess over daily market ups and downs, since real success comes from holding investments for the long term. From Fisher, Buffett developed a strong focus on the quality of a company’s management. He realized that great leadership can make a significant difference in a business’s long-term value. Fisher also warned that over-diversifying could backfire, making it harder to properly monitor each investment. Buffett clearly follows this thinking, since his $267 billion portfolio is concentrated in just 38 stocks as of Q4 2024. Warren Buffett’s investment strategy is a masterclass in disciplined and fundamentals-driven investing. His focus is on companies with durable competitive advantages, which he refers to as economic moats, combined with strong management and solid capital allocation. The Oracle of Omaha is against chasing trends. Instead, he looks for long-term value and buys only when a company is trading below its intrinsic worth. Buffett’s approach with the iPhone-maker is a great case in point. He was not just impressed by the hardware; he saw the value in its services ecosystem, like the App Store and iCloud, which generate consistent, high-margin revenue. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the Berkshire billionaire shared a remark with investors that remains just as relevant in the current stock market landscape. He wrote: “Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.” Buffett also emphasizes simplicity and efficiency. Despite his success as a stock picker, he recommends low-cost S&P index funds for most investors, believing they outperform most professionals over time. At its core, Buffett’s strategy is not flashy, and he offers a blueprint for sustainable wealth creation. This article presents the Warren Buffett stock picks that are especially suitable for new investors looking to build a strong portfolio. An Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables. For this article, we explored Warren Buffett’s Q4 2024 portfolio, picking 12 stocks with the highest hedge fund sentiment. These stocks are backed by Wall Street hedge funds and the Oracle of Omaha himself. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey's Q4 2024. We also included the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in each company for further context. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 166 Berkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $75,126,000,000 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. He initially bought 39.2 million shares in the first quarter of 2016 and has steadily increased his stake since then. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in Apple were valued at over $75 billion. It is one of the best Warren Buffett stock picks for beginners. On April 28, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $235, up from $220. Morgan Stanley expects the stock to stay stable short term, and sees long-term growth driven by strong cash flow and Services growth. Morgan Stanley is confident in Apple’s financial strength despite near-term uncertainties. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its biggest American investment yet on February 24, which is a $500 billion commitment over the next four years. The company plans to pour money into areas like AI, silicon engineering, advanced manufacturing, and job training across the country. Part of the plan includes doubling its US Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion, building a new server facility in Houston, expanding data centers in multiple states, and boosting chip production with Taiwan Semiconductor in Arizona. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 166 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 158 funds in the last quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’sArrowstreet Capitalwas a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 26.6 million shares valued at $6.6 billion. Overall, AAPLranks 3rdamong the best Warren Buffett stock picks for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

As the Silicon Valley giant prepares to release its...,Yahoo Entertainment,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-earnings-coming-heres-watch-090000718.html,"Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Wall Street is about to find out just how far the Apple (AAPL) may fall from its trillion-dollar tree. As the Silicon Valley giant prepares to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Thursday, the world’s most valuable tech company finds itself at the intersection of profit — and politics. While Apple’s fundamentals remain sound, a rising tide of tariffs, overseas competitors, and investor skepticism all threaten to affect what once seemed like a bulletproof company. And apprehension levels are rising. Still, analysts expect yet another quarter of reliable, if unspectacular, growth — earnings per share of $1.60, up about 5% from the same period a year ago, on revenue of $94.2 billion, a 3.8% year-over-year increase. Apple had projected low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth for this second quarter from the prior year. The company has outpaced Wall Street’s earnings expectations for four consecutive quarters. Growth this quarter will likely continue to be driven by Apple’s services and iPad segments — especially as hardware sales growth re-balances. President Donald Trump’s tariffs-induced trade war has turned into a structural headwind for Apple’s global operations. The company manufactures about 90% of its iPhones sold in the U.S. in China — and they’re subject to steep tariffs… that could get even steeper. Trump has imposed a 145% levy on all goods imported from China. While the White House temporarily spared smartphones from the harshest penalties, the administration has hinted that those protections might be fleeting. Earlier this month, Apple’s stock tumbled more than 25% around the president’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. But shares rebounded 15% about a week later, following those early signs of a potential easing in smartphone-related tariff policies. The tariffs affect more than just Apple’s iPhones, too. The Trump administration’s restrictions on high-performance chips could affect Apple’s supply chains — especially given the company’s reliance on advanced semiconductors. Apple’s response to the tariffs on China has been swift: The company has moved to sharply increase iPhone production in India, with a goal to manufactureall U.S.-bound unitsthere by 2026. But analysts remain cautious about the move. “India is progressing, but it’s not China,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson. “Efficiency and yield remain lower. Tariff mitigation is working — barely — but margins could come under pressure if this persists.” Apple has also diversified production to Vietnam and Malaysia, but the geopolitical risk remains sticky. For years, China has been both a crucial manufacturing base and a major consumer market for Apple. But that dual role has become fraught. In the first quarter of 2025, Apple’s shipments in China fell 8% to 12% year-over-year, driven by intensifying competition from domestic players such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and Honor, along with growing nationalistic preferences among Chinese consumers. In its second-quarter report, investors will look for clear guidance from Apple’s leadership on how it plans to navigate escalating U.S.-China trade tensions — whether the company intends to absorb the rising tariff costs or pass them on to consumers; to renegotiate supplier contracts, or accelerate its supply chain diversification into other countries. And if price hikes are on the table, a big question will be whether Apple concentrates those increases on U.S. buyers or spreads them across its global customer base. “The biggest concern surrounding the Apple story is the trade war with China,” Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White said in a client note Thursday. “Even under the most favorable outcome, we expect Apple’s U.S. prices to increase, and manufacturing capacity to continue migrating out of China.” If geopolitics represents the clear external threat, Apple’s muted innovation cycle represents an internal one. Since the iPhone 11’s launch in 2019, Apple has released strong — but evolutionary — hardware updates. Its iPhone 16 is approaching the midpoint of the cycle, and other product releases, such as the M3-powered iPad Air, are expected to only provide a limited boost. Apple has been slowly moving manufacturing of its Macs and iPads outside of China — but at a much slower rate than it has for its iPhones. As a result, those two categories could be ripe for more trade disruption. And even worse, Apple’s much-hyped and ambitious AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, remains in limbo. Investors will certainly be looking for positive updates on that front. The good news for the company is that the services segment — which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and other recurring streams — continues to grow at a healthy double-digit pace, now contributing nearly a quarter of total revenue. But with iPhone revenue still making up over 50%, services alone can’t carry the growth narrative indefinitely. Despite the headwinds, Apple remains a cash-generating juggernaut. The company is expected to post net income of $24.2 billion this quarter. Long-term investors may see this pullback as a rare opportunity to buy into a still-dominant franchise under what they hope is temporary distress. But Apple’s days as a pure growth story may be behind it. Earnings can no longer just hinge on product cycles; investors have to take into account how deftly the company can navigate global politics, diversify its supply chain, and close the widening AI gap — while still growing its product lineup, of course. Thursday’s earnings call will offer one of the clearest signals yet: Is Apple still the safe haven stock of old — or has it become a bellwether of how trade wars and tech decoupling could reshape Silicon Valley’s biggest players?

One piece of news that may have helped move the market higher on Tuesday, though, was President Trump's decision to scale back on auto tariffs. Investors seem to be looking forward to any news of progress on trade negotiations and key economic data, namely Q1 GDP, March personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), and the April jobs report. There are also some important earnings this week, includingMETA Platforms, Inc.(META),Microsoft Corp.(MSFT),Amazon.com, Inc.(AMZN), andApple, Inc.(AAPL), among others. So, don't be surprised if there's some turbulence this week. Recent economic data hasn't moved the needle much. The latest JOLTS report showed fewer job openings in March, but layoffs declined. This indicates the labor market is still strong. The April nonfarm payrolls report on Friday will bring more clarity. Consumer confidence took a hit, falling to its lowest reading since May 2020. This drop reflects concerns about tariffs and how they might push up prices. The bottom line is that consumers are nervous about what's ahead. Despite its bounce, theS&P 500($SPX) is still down around 9.0% from its February high, but up about 15% from its April lows. Theweekly chart belowhas the Fibonacci retracement levels from the October 2022 lows to the February 2025 highs. The index bounced off its 50% retracement level and is now above its 38.2% level. It's also trading below its 40-weeksimple moving average(SMA), which is the equivalent of a 200-day SMA. FIGURE 1. WEEKLY CHART ANALYSIS OF S&P 500. The index has bounced off its 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and breadth is improving. However, the market appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, and any negative news could send the index lower.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes. It's encouraging to see the S&P 500Bullish Percent Index(BPI) above 50%, and the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 200-day moving average showing slight signs of reversing from a downtrend. However, the S&P 500 appears indecisive and is waiting for some catalyst to move the index in either direction. Doesthe daily chartshow a different scenario? Let's take a look. FIGURE 2. DAILY CHART ANALYSIS OF S&P 500. The 50% Fibonacci retracement level is an important level to monitor since it could act as a support level. Resistance levels to the upside are the 50-day moving average, the 61.8% Fib retracement level, and the 200-day moving average.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes. The daily chart of the S&P 500 above shows the index trading below its 200-day SMA. In addition, the 50%Fibonacci retracement level(from the February 2025 high to the April 2025 low) is acting as a support level.One point to note is the wide-ranging days in April, which have subsided toward the end of the month. This suggests investors have calmed downâthe Cboe Volatility Index($VIX) has pulled back and is now below 30. The short-term perspective shows the trend is leaning toward moving higher. Keep an eye on the 5500 level as support and the 50-day SMA as the next resistance level. If the S&P 500 can break above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level with strong momentum, that's reason to be optimistic. A break above the 200-day SMA would be more optimistic. While the S&P 500 is inching higher, something is brewing beneath the surfaceâa shift toward the more defensive sectors. TheRelative Rotation Graphbelow shows that for the week, defensive sectorsâConsumer Staples, Utilities, and Health Careâare leading, while offensive sectors, like Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services, are lagging. FIGURE 3. RELATIVE ROTATION GRAPH. Defensive sectors are leading while offensive sectors are lagging. Monitor sector rotation carefully as we head into a volatile trading week.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes. This isn't unusual, since investors are feeling more cautious and looking for stability. There's still key economic data to monitor this week. Here's what's ahead: The market is feeling cautious, waiting for the next catalyst to send stock prices higher or lower. And any of this week's eventsâeconomic data, big tech earnings, and trade talksâcould make or break this week's price action. However, even if the S&P 500 trends higher, it doesn't necessarily mean the big tech growth stocks are leading the move higher.

The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — thoughno interest rate changeis expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN) and Clorox (CLX) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meetingbegins Tuesdayand runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA). Arista Networks (ANET) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR), Duke Energy (DUK), Suncor (SU), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE) and Marriot(MAR)round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as theFOMC meetingconcludes. While no rate change isexpected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN) and Cheniere Energy (LNG) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP), DoorDash (DASH), and Arm Holdings (ARM) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

At 94,Warren Buffett(Trades,Portfolio)still draws a full house. This year's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, Financials) meeting in Omaha mixed business, wisdom, and light-hearted charmwith long-term thinking at the center of it all. Buffett said Berkshire's stakes in five major Japanese firmsMitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Itochu, and Marubeniare meant to last decades. He praised their culture and said Berkshire won't be pushing for change. Trade policy came up too. He flagged tariffs and shifting rules as growing risksechoing concerns from Berkshire's latest earnings report. Buffett reflected on the responsibility of managing others' money. Unlike many firms, he said, Berkshire doesn't walk away from bad bets. The outcomes stick. He also called out Apple (AAPL,Financials) as Berkshire's most rewarding investment and the only earnings call he follows. He credited CEO Tim Cook for much of that success. Buffett dismissed talk of stockpiling cash for his successor. It's still about waiting for the right dealnot appearances. He left younger investors with a simple reminder: chase work you love. That, he said, leads to a longer, better life. Despite travel delays, more than 20,000 made it to Omaha.

Buffett, 94, spent more than six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, which was Apple’s largest institutional shareholder until last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared a photo of himself and Buffett smiling together at Apple Park, along with a personal tribute to the legendary investor. “There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,” Cook wrote. “It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.” Buffett’s backing of Apple has been one of the most influential investments of his career—but it didn’t start that way. For years, he avoided Apple and other tech stocks,citing their unpredictabilityand his rule to “never invest in a business you cannot understand.” There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom. It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there’s no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.pic.twitter.com/7p5zXtq5hP “We held very few in the past and we’re likely to hold very few in the future,” he said in 2012. “Coca-Cola is very easy for me to come to a conclusion as to what it will look like economically in five or 10 years, and it’s not easy for me to come to a conclusion about Apple.” That changed in 2016, when Berkshire Hathawaybegan buying Apple stock, eventually becoming its largest institutional shareholder. Buffett came to see Apple not as a traditional tech company, but as a consumer business with unmatched brand loyalty and recurring revenue. His long-term commitment helped legitimize Apple among value investors and reinforced its status as a cornerstone of the global economy. Although Berkshire has reduced its Apple stake, the firm still holds roughly $75 billion in AAPL shares. The Vanguard Group overtook Berkshire in 2024 to become Apple’s largest institutional shareholder, with a reported 9% stake. Berkshiretrimmednearly two-thirds of its Apple holdings last year, helping drive its record cash reserves past $300 billion. Buffett’s successor, 62-year-old Greg Abel, will assume the CEO role at the end of the year. Theannouncementcame during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting—an event that, six years ago, gave rise toWarren Buffett’s Paper Wizard, a whimsical iOS game released in partnership with Apple.

Buffett told investors that Berkshire nearly pulled the trigger on a $10 billion acquisition but walked away because the math didn't work.

Buffett criticized the use of tariffs as economic leverage, saying, Trade should not be a weapon.

Still, he struck an optimistic note about America's long-term strength, calling the day he was born in the U.S. the luckiest day of my life.

We recently published a list of10 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to billionaires. The latest market data shows that the US economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025. This was a rapid reversal from the 2.4% growth in the last quarter of 2024. The further segregation of the data shows that tariff uncertainty was one of the key contributing factors toward the slowdown, as net exports dropped 4.8%. According to a recent report by CNBC, traders highlighted that the imports were skewed up 41% last quarter as a preparatory move by companies to get ahead of the tariff situation. In this backdrop, the NASDAQ slipped another 0.09% on May 1, to end at 17,446.34. On April 30, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joined CNBC to talk about the outlook of the stock market amidst the tariff situation. He noted that the stock market is currently trying to figure out the trajectory of the economy as it is clear that the economic data for the next 3 quarters will be polluted by the tariffs and other distortions that follow. Lee highlighted that there are two questions that the market is trying to figure out. The first question is whether this is a dip and noise for 2025 only and the market exists in better shape as 2026 approaches. If this is the case then Lee believes that Equities have already made their lows with the S&P 500 at 4,835 on April 7. This will be the better-case scenario of all the possible outcomes. However, if the market feels that the uncertainty is dragging into a few more quarters in 2025 then that could be harmful for the stock market. CNBC’s Steve Liesman added to Tom Lee’s comments by mentioning that the current stock market is the President’s market. He highlighted that when President Trump took charge the stock market rallied, however, the later policies hampered the sentiment and took the stock market down with it. Liseman further elaborated that before all these policy uncertainties the forecasts for GDP in 2025 were at 2% growth each quarter. However, now the first quarter ended up at -0.3% with an expectation of 1.6% growth next quarter. Liseman concluded that the market might see the economy bouncing back in the next quarter allowing investors to make sense of the outlook. Amidst this uncertainty, Lee has emphasized the importance of staying invested in times of volatility to reap the benefits. We have covered more analysis from Tom Lee in10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.

The analyst noted that the company is anticipated to grow its revenue by 4% year-over-year during the March and June quarters. Sankar highlighted that despite the tariff situation, the demand for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products has increased in the United States. Moreover, the services segment of the company is also anticipated to grow by 11% year-over-year. While the tariffs might hamper the iPhone unit sales in China, however, there is a significant upside in the United States, driven by the inventory build-up.

Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after the company reported mixed first-quarter 2025 (fiscal Q2) results, which narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations, amid tariff concerns. CEO Tim Cook stated during the earnings call that anticipated tariffs could cost the company around $900 million in the current quarter (about 1% of total revenue). Also, sales in China saw a decline of 2%. This is a crucial market for Apple, and any signs of weakness there are usually viewed negatively. Overall, this print was decent, but the areas below expectations seem to be driving the move. The shares closed the day at $205.25, down 3.6% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple?Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Apple’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 23 days ago when the stock gained 4.8% as markets rallied sharply on news that President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. Reciprocal tariffs were also dropped to 10% for most countries, sparking renewed optimism amid ongoing trade talks. The major stock indices rose as investors, growing impatient of seemingly irrational tariff actions, welcomed the pause as a sign of a more measured path forward. However, Trump was quick to note that China was not part of the pause. Instead, he prepared to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% after China announced retaliatory tariffs on US imports. This tough stance on China stood in sharp contrast to the softer tone toward others. In a week marked by growing uncertainty, this news eased some of the pressure. The questions remain whether we are out of the woods and can sustain the rally or not. Apple is down 15.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $205.45 per share, it is trading 20.7% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,803. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

AAPL,2025-05-02,Tim Cook Says Tariffs Will Cost Apple at Least $900M in April-June Quarter,"Apple CEO Tim Cook warns of rising tariff costs and outlines plans to shift more production to India, Vietnam and U.S. facilities.",Observer,https://observer.com/2025/05/tariffs-900m-bite-apple/,"Apple (AAPL)CEOTim Cookwas peppered with seemingly nonstop tariff questions during the company’s quarterly earnings call yesterday (May 1). Addressing mounting concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions, Cook revealed that current tariffs could cost the iPhone maker $900 million in the April–June period. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=""http://observermedia.com/terms"">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. “Assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs,” Cook told analysts. “For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have—with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates,” he added. Apple manufactures the vast majority of its iPhones in China, placing it in a difficult position in an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. While consumer electronics have been temporarily exempted from PresidentDonald Trump’s proposed 125 percent reciprocal tariffs, Apple products still face a 20 percent levy—and more could be on the way. Cook acknowledged that due to continued uncertainty around trade policy, Apple is unable to forecast tariff costs beyond the current quarter. For the moment, however, he said the company has not made any pricing changes and has not seen a surge in consumer demand driven by fears of future price hikes. Apple posted strong results in all markets except China. Total revenue rose 5 percent year-over-year to $95.4 billion in the first three months of 2025, beating Wall Street expectations. iPhone sales reached $46.8 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago, while Mac and iPad sales climbed 7 percent and 15 percent, respectively. In recent years, Apple has reduced its reliance on China by shifting product production to India, which currently producesbetween 10 percent to 15 percent of its iPhones. Over the next three months, Apple expects the “majority” of U.S. iPhones to come from India, while Vietnam will be responsible for manufacturing “almost all” U.S. iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and AirPod products, said Cook. China will remain the primary hub for Apple’s international production outside of the U.S. Cook also emphasized Apple’s investments in U.S. manufacturing. In February, the company announced plans to spend$500 billion over the next five yearson domestic initiatives, including a new facility in Houston focused on producing servers for A.I. In 2025, Apple will expand several of its U.S. teams, source 19 billion chips from suppliers across a dozen states, and continue producing components like iPhone glass through American suppliers. The moves mark a broader strategic shift aimed at mitigating geopolitical risk. “What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it,” said Cook. “You could see that kind of thing continuing in the future,” he added, underscoring Apple’s long-term commitment to supply chain resilience."

Despite Apple beating expectations for the fifth straight quarter, investors were less focused on what the company just reported and more on what lies ahead: a turbulent macroeconomic horizon, slowing margins, anda looming $900 million tariff hit. The elephant in the earnings room wasn’t just softer services revenue or a continued sales slump in China. It was the growing threat of geopolitical fallout — particularly President Donald Trump’s escalating tariff regime, which is forcing Apple into a major supply chain reshuffle. But amid the rising uncertainty, Apple still showed why it’s built to weather global storms. The company reported $95.4 billion in revenue on Thursday after the bell — up 5% year-over-year — and earnings of $1.65 per share, up 8%, riding strong demand in the U.S. and parts of Asia. Those figures beat expectations of $94.2 billion in revenue and $1.60 EPS. Still, the glow was tempered. Services underdelivered, revenue from China remained in decline, and product margins slipped. And with what Wedbush analysts have dubbed the “tariff tornado” circling just ahead of Apple’s expected iPhone 17 launch, the path forward looks anything but simple. Apple stock was down about 3% in midday trading on Friday. The shares have fallen about 15% so far this year amid the broader selloff in tech stocks. Here’s what to know. The biggest concern for Apple is one that’s looming: tariffs. For the most part, the only thing analysts wanted to ask CEO Tim Cook about on the earnings call was the company’s tariff-related exposure. He said the company saw a “limited impact” from Trump’s levies in the second quarter — but things could get much worse in the third quarter. Apple, he said, could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs for next quarter — if current global tariff rates, policies, and applications remain the same. At the moment, there’s a 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Cook said Apple mitigated second-quarter costs by moving a large chunk of its supply chain to India, where 50% of iPhones for the U.S. are currently coming from. Cook said the majority of iPhones for the June quarter will continue to come from India. Vietnam, meanwhile, will be the country of origin for almost all of Apple’s iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods sold in the U.S. China will remain the primary country of origin for most non-U.S. product sales. This strategic pivot could minimize the tariffs’ impact, but analysts remain divided on just how effective the pivot away from China might be. Jefferies analysts estimated that if tariffs go up by 1 percentage point and Apple doesn’t raise product prices, its pre-tax profits for the year could fall by about 1.5 percentage points. Wedbush analysts, however, raised their price target on Apple stock, citing Apple’s apparent mastery over a highly complex supply chain shift. In a note, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives emphasized that Apple’s pivot to India and Vietnam gives the company enough runway to avoid major disruption ahead of the iPhone 17 launch in September, calling India the “life raft” of Apple’s global manufacturing strategy. Chinese tariffs weren’t the only China-related headwind Apple saw: Revenue in the country continued to decline, by 2% in the second quarter. However, it was a marked improvement from the previous quarter, which saw a substantial 11% drop. The takeaway: A 2% decline isn’t great, but it could have been much worse. This stabilization was partly driven by Chinese government subsidies for consumer electronics, which helped support demand for devices such as the iPhone 16e and the newest iPad Air. Jefferies noted these subsidies likely cushioned Apple’s revenue slide in China, especially as the recent iPhone 16e targeted price-sensitive buyers. Cook pointed out that, when factoring out the foreign exchange headwinds, Apple’s revenue in the country was effectively flat. While the Chinese market remains challenging, the worst may be behind Apple in the region. Still, Chinese nationalism and consumer preferences for locally made devices remain key risks, especially with the heightened geopolitical tensions. For years, the Services segment — which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, AppleCare — has been Apple’s crown jewel. But in the second quarter, that glow dimmed, if only slightly. Services revenue still achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared with the previous year, despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. But that was below Wall Street’s expectations. Revenue came in at $26.6 billion, below the $26.7 billion analysts anticipated. Partially as a result of those lackluster figures, Apple stock dipped in after-hours trading on Thursday and continued to slump Friday. Jefferies noted that Services drove 60% of Apple’s total revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by a record-high gross margin of 75.7%. That strength offset weaker hardware margins. But concerns persist. Behind the scenes, several headwinds were at play. Regulatory scrutiny of the App Store’s fees had begun to impact margins. Subscription fatigue was spreading, as consumers reconsidered monthly commitments in the face of global economic pressures. And Apple’s push into original content and sports streaming, while strategic, hadn’t yet yielded blockbuster financial returns. “We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially, however, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis,” Apple CFO Kevan Parekh said. “With respect to Services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren’t providing the category level of color today.” For now, the golden goose is still laying eggs — but they’re leading some to wonder if they’re as golden as they used to be. Apple’s second-quarter earnings were buoyed by American consumers rushing to buy Apple products before Trump’s far-reaching tariffs could really take hold. The company also released the iPhone 16e during its second quarter, a lower-end phone that comes with limited AI features. On the whole, Apple beat expectations across much of its hardware department, reporting iPhone revenue of $46.84 billion (versus $45.84 billion estimated), Mac revenue of $7.95 billion (versus $7.77 billion estimated), and iPad revenue of $6.4 billion (versus $6.20 billion estimated). CFO Parekh cited a Kantar study that said, during the March quarter, the iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and Japan. He added, “We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97%, as measured by 451 Research.” But Jeffries analysts noted that iPhone gross margins fell by 1 percentage point year over year to 38.3%, the lowest in the past five years for a March quarter. Overall product gross margin dropped 0.7 percentage point to below 36%, also the lowest number for a March quarter in the past five years. Parekh attributed the margin compression to mix, foreign exchange, and a seasonal loss of leverage,” but Jefferies believes “faster builds and speedy March shipments” may also be to blame. Cook said he “strongly disagrees with” a judge’s antitrust ruling that Apple had violated a previous injunction related to its App Store policies. A California District Court ruled against Apple in its continuing litigation with Epic Games, ordering Apple to allow developers to link to external payment systems — an injunction that could hit App Store commission revenues. “We’ve complied with the court’s order, and we’re gonna appeal,” Cook said. The European Commission is also investigating Apple’s practices around Apple Pay and third-party app distribution. Cook added that Apple’s antitrust lawsuit — and monopoly suits Google (GOOGL) is facing — cast a specter over the tech industry. Responding to a question on the earnings call about the mounting legal risk, Cook said, “We’re monitoring these closely, but as you point out, there’s risk associated with them and the the outcome is unclear.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

As Big Tech and other firms continue to grapple with the Trump administration’s shifting tariff policies, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s latest earnings call that tariffs could cost it $900 million this quarter. “For the June quarter, currently we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter,” Cook said Thursday afterthe company reported second-quarter earnings. “However... assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. “This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters,” he added, “as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter.” Apple expects to buy more than 19 billion chips from U.S. manufacturers this year and continue to shift manufacturing away from China to India, Cook said. For the June quarter, he said, “we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin, and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products also sold in the U.S.” However, China will continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of product sales outside the U.S.,Cook said on the earnings call. Cook said Apple will lean more on TSMC(TSM), which is expanding its Arizona operations to half a dozen plants. Apple’s quarterly earnings,reported Thursday, rose 8% from the prior year to $1.65 per share, exceeding expectations. The company’s stock was still down about 4% in Friday morning trading, reflecting investor concerns about escalating tariff costs and lower sales in China. Apple already makes 20%, or one in five, of its iPhones in India. It expects to import most of the iPhones for the U.S. from India by the end of next year.

Read more...",Quartz India,https://qz.com/aapl-amzn-msft-brk-b-xom-1851778803,"U.S. stocks moved sharply higher Friday followinga better than expected April jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 612 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to extend its recent winning streak, and the Nasdaq added 1.8% following a spate of Big Tech earnings this week. President Donald Trumptook to Truth Socialfollowing the jobs report, renewing his frequent calls for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. “Just like I said, and we’re only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!” he said. “Consumers have been waiting for years to see pricing come down. NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD LOWER ITS RATE!!!” The already fragile U.S. economy came under further focus Friday morning withthe release of the April jobs report, which showed slowed but solid growth. U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%, according to the report released by the Labor Department. There’s little in the numbers to suggest that Trump’s tariffs took a substantial toll on the job market as of mid-April. The numbers are better than expected: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated that employers added 130,000 jobs last month and expected the unemployment rate to remain steady, which it did (and which it has since May 2024). April’s numbers show hiring came back to Earth some after the unexpectedly high 228,000 jobs added in March. April’s jobs numbers are an improvement over the 114,000 average seen in January and February. Shares of Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were trading lower Friday after releasing earnings reports that showed profits hit by falling oil prices and tariff impacts. Chevron net incomedeclined30% year over year. Exxonsawprofits drop 6% but still managed to beat analyst estimates. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) both beat earnings expectations — but the market reaction split. ApplereportedEPS of $1.65 and 5% revenue growth to $95 billion on strong iPhone sales. But shares are down more than 3% premarket, as investors eye a potential $900 million tariff hit in the June quarter. AmazonpostedEPS of $1.59, beating estimates by double digits, with net sales of $155.7 billion and operating margin at a record 11.8%. AWS revenue rose 17% to $29.3 billion, but analysts on the call pressed for details on growth trends and AI monetization. CEO Andy Jassy pitched AWS as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity, noting 85% of global IT remains off-cloud. AWS now brings in $117 billion annually and serves clients like Adobe (ADBE), Uber (UBER), and Nasdaq. “We’re investing in AI in a huge way,” he said, citing 1,000+ internal apps and growing demand for infrastructure-scale deployments. As for tariffs and Amazon’s vast retail operation, Jassy said affordability remains a priority. “We’re working hard to keep prices low, which is even more important now,” he said, adding that Amazon’s latest global deal events saved customers over $500 million. Despite macro headwinds, “we’re not seeing attenuation of demand — more like heightened buying,” he said. Apple stock was down 3.7%, while Amazon stock rose 1.2%.

(Bloomberg) — Apple (AAPL) plans to source more than 19 billion chips from the US this year, part of a global supply chain shift to gradually lessen its reliance on China and elevate India for iPhone production. Most Read from Bloomberg NJ Transit Urges Commuters to Work Remotely If Union Strikes NYC Lost $9 Billion of Income to Miami, Palm Beach in Five Years New York City Transit System Chips Away at Subway Fare Evasion NYC’s MTA to Cut Costs Instead of Borrowing More to Fund Upgrades NYC’s Congestion Toll Raised $159 Million in the First Quarter Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook talked about leaning more heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) , which is expanding its Arizona operations to half a dozen plants. He also affirmed expectations that Apple will in future make the vast majority of its US-bound iPhones in India — reducing output from China as the Donald Trump administration threatens to slap punitive tariffs on its Asian rival. India was mentioned almost as many times as China on Thursday’s post-earnings conference call, reflecting its rising importance. Cook however was mum on a series of questions about how potential tariffs on consumer electronics may affect Apple’s business, saying “it’s very difficult to predict beyond June.” Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said Apple’s commentary on the call assumes that current global tariff rates and policies remain in effect and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn’t worsen. The Cupertino, California-based company’s much-awaited quarterly earnings report failed to soothe investor concerns about its biggest challenges, including escalating tariff costs and a slowdown in China. The company’s shares declined as much as 4.2% in late trading Thursday after Apple released second-quarter results that included worse-than-expected sales in China. Apple has accelerated its manufacturing expansion in India, which is both rising as a market — at a time when Apple’s China sales keep declining — and is likely to be a more politically favored US trade partner over the long run. Apple already makes 20%, or one in five, of its iPhones in the South Asian country. It expects to import most of the iPhones for the US from India by the end of next year. “We have a complex supply chain, there’s always risk in the supply chain,” Cook told analysts on the call. “What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it and so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it, opened up new sources of supply.” Beyond India, Trump wants Apple to begin building its devices in the US. But that’s unlikely to happen at scale in the foreseeable future. For now, Cook pledged to ramp up local procurement of chips and other components. The iPhone maker will obtain tens of millions of advanced processors from a new facility in Arizona operated by TSMC this year, Cook said. That’s started making processors for low-end iPads and Apple Watches, Bloomberg News has reported. Apple and TSMC have both announced US investments amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars in line with the White House’s push to bring advanced manufacturing to the country. Trump’s administration has imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and threatened additional levies to other nations who don’t negotiate new trade agreements over the coming weeks. Some electronics including iPhones are at present exempt. The Apple CEO also discussed how the company sources glass for iPhone screens from the US, likely referring to Corning Inc. Earlier this year, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years, including by manufacturing AI servers at a plant in Texas. —With assistance from Edwin Chan.

She added, ""It's less popular to come to the US from a year ago also relative to the beginning of the year."" Mertz noted the trend has had little impact on the company's quarterly results since US visits by foreign travelers account for 2% to 3% of the platform's overall business. Airbnb topped Wall Street estimates for earnings and revenue, though itssecond quarter outlookcame in weaker than expected. Readmore here.

On a year-over-year basis, industry employment has grown by 1.7% to 143,000 jobs. “Despite weak construction spending data for March and several economic headwinds, including high interest rates, tight lending standards, and trade policy uncertainty, backlog remains sufficiently elevated to keep industry employment growing for the time being,” Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said in a statement. The construction unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in April, while unemployment across all industries remained at 4.2%. “That said, April is likely the last month of economic data largely unaffected by tariffs and tariff-related uncertainty. The reference period for today’s jobs report is the pay period through April 12, which may exclude staffing decisions, or project cancellations or delays, related to recent trade policy developments. While the economic outlook has worsened in recent weeks, it remains unclear how the economy will respond in the coming months,” Basu added. Block (XYZ) shares fell sharply on Friday after the financial services and digital payments company cut its full-year gross profit outlook, which came in below the average analyst estimate. For the first quarter, the company behind Square and CashApp reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, well above analyst estimates of $0.47. However, revenue came in at around $5.7 billion, missing the forecast of $6.2 billion. Looking ahead, Block expects full-year adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion, representing a 19% gross margin, down from its prior guidance of $2.1 billion. It also expects a full-year gross profit of $9.96 billion, below the consensus estimate of $10.18 billion. The payments processor cited the economic uncertainty for its cautious outlook. “We recognize we are operating in a more dynamic macro environment, so we have reflected a more cautious stance on the macro outlook into our guidance for the rest of the year,” Blocksaid in its shareholder letter. Several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock, including Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Bauch, who changed his rating to Equal Weight from Overweight and lowered his price target to $50 from $95. Bauch stated that it is too difficult to recommend the shares at their current level, citing ""(1) a heavily back half weighted guide, (2) growing credit contributions and (3) numerous Cash App monetization red flags.” Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Readmore here. Stocks rallied on Friday as the labor market proved resilient in the face of the tariff policy revealed by President Trump in early April and as China indicated it is willing to talk with the US about a trade deal.

During the company’squarterly earningscall Thursday, Cook said a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. this quarter will comefrom India, rather than China, with iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and other products coming mostly from Vietnam. The comments come amid concerns the company could be particularly hurt by trade tensions with China, where Apple manufactured an estimated 90% of its products until recently. Most Apple products areexemptfrom President Trump's 125%""reciprocal"" tariffson Chinese goods, but still affected by the 20% import tax the White House put in place earlier in the year to combat fentanyl trafficking, Cook noted. Cook also warned the impact of tariffs to Apple's results could change, given the company is “uncertain of potential future actions” the administration could take. Trump has said he expects tariffs on China“will come down substantially”in trade negotiations but not drop to zero. Apple reported fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings thatsurpassed analysts’ expectations, with higher-than-expected iPhone sales. Shares of Apple fell about 4% in extended trading.

Fiscal second-quarter earnings show that the Apple (AAPL) hasn’t lost its shine. Thursday after the bell, Apple reported $95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% year-over-year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year amid robust demand, even as geopolitics threaten its supply-chain wizardry. But while the company beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the fifth quarter in a row — exceeding estimates of $1.60 EPS and $94.2 billion in revenue — sales from its key services unit and from China disappointed. Apple’s second-quarter earnings were buoyed by American consumers rushing to buy Apple products before President Donald Trump’s far-reaching tariffs could really take hold. The company also released the iPhone 16e during its second quarter, a lower-end phone that comes with limited AI features. On the whole, Apple beat expectations across much of its hardware department, reporting iPhone revenue of $46.84 billion (versus $45.84 billion estimated), Mac revenue of $7.95 billion (versus $7.77 billion estimated), and iPad revenue of $6.4 billion (versus $6.20 billion estimated). Yet its services segment — which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and other recurring streams — just missed expectations, coming in at $26.65 billion, below the $26.70 billion analysts anticipated. Services revenue was still up 11.65% from a year ago. Apple’s stock slid more than 2% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Apple was among the hardest-hit tech giants due to its exposure to China, where it currently manufactures 90% of the iPhones it sells in the U.S. Almost every question during the company’s earnings call had to do with tariffs. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company saw “limited impact” from tariff-related effects this quarter, largely due to a temporary exemption for electronics. “We are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of this quarter,” he said. But, he added, if current global tariff rates remain the same, the financial impact could be significant next quarter: Apple could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs for the June quarter. President Donald Trump’s trade war has turned into a structural headwind for Apple’s global operations. To mitigate tariff risks, Apple is accelerating its shift away from China. Now, Cook said, most of Apple’s third-quarter iPhone sales will come from devices assembled in India, with other products increasingly produced in Vietnam. Apple sought to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs by shipping approximately $2 billion worth of iPhones from India to the U.S.; the company did so to maintain its inventory levels and stave off price hikes. ​ On the earnings call, Cook was also asked about a blockbuster antitrust ruling yesterday that said Apple violated an order to reform its App Store.

During the call, Apple CEOTim Cookspoke about tariffs, theApp Storechanges Apple is facing, device sales, and more. We've rounded up the most interesting tidbits from the Q2 2025 earnings call below. Cook was asked about some of the high-profile legal cases that Apple is facing right now, including the U.S. ‌App Store‌ changes that Apple was ordered to make yesterday, and how those legal cases might impact Apple's services business. Cook repeated Apple's statement about complying and appealing, and didn't add much more beyond saying that the outcome is unclear. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with it. We've complied with the court's order, and we're going to appeal. In the DoJ case you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing, and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. We're monitoring these closely. But as you point out, there's risk associated with them. And the outcome is unclear. Cook said that tariffshad a limited impacton the March quarter because Apple was able to optimize its supply chain and inventory. Apple is unable to entirely estimate the impact of tariffs on the June quarter because policies could change, but if everything stays as it is now, the tariffs will add $900 million to Apple's costs. Cook declined to speak on pricing or whether elevated costs will be passed along to consumers. Cook said that Apple is sourcing glass andFace IDmodules from the United States, along with purchasing 19 billion chips from 12 states. Cook said that Apple is ""making progress"" onthe personal Siri featuresthat the company announced at WWDC 2024. ""We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands,"" said Cook. ""It's just taking a bit longer than we thought,"" Cook added. Cook said that during the March quarter, Apple saw year over year performance in countries withApple Intelligencethat was stronger than those countries where ‌Apple Intelligence‌ was not available. Mac revenue grew 6.7 percent year over year, thanks to the new M4MacBook AirandMac Studiothat came out during the quarter. The Mac install base grew to an all-time high, and Apple saw growth for upgraders and customers new to the Mac. iPadrevenue grew 15.2 percent year over year, with growth in every geographic segment. More than half of customers who purchased an ‌iPad‌ were new to the product. Apple debuted the M3iPad Airand the ‌iPad‌ 11 during the quarter. Wearables revenue dropped 4.9 percent year over year due to a difficult compare against the launch of theApple Vision Proin the year-ago quarter. Apple's services revenue was up 11.6 percent year over year, an all-time revenue record, with strong performance across all categories.Apple TV+ set a new record for viewership during the quarter, and paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year. Apple now has more than 1 billion total paid subscriptions."

With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features, so they meet our high quality bar. We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Apple first unveiled the more personalized ‌Siri‌ features at WWDC 2024, and rumors suggested that the plan was to introduce them with an update toiOS 18. That didn't happen, and Apple earlier this year said that there would be a delay because more time was needed for development. At this point, the new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features will be held foriOS 19, and it is not yet clear if they will be in the first ‌iOS 19‌ release or held for a later update. Apple's delay wording suggested that we could be waiting until 2026 for the functionality. Behind the scenes, Apple made a number of changes to ‌Siri‌ leadership, moving AI chief John Giannandreaoff of the projectand instead turning to Mike Rockwell, who handled Vision Pro development."

And as usual, Wall Street will be paying close attention to what Warren Buffett says about the tumult in today’s markets and economy, as well as what the Oracle of Omaha’s crystal ball tells him about the future. The company’s stock has been on a tear, up 17% so far this year and outperforming the S&P 500. But with recession fears causing a possible slowdown in investment and with a growing focus on Berkshire’s line of succession, this quarter’s numbers could tell investors more than usual. Analysts are projecting adjusted first-quarter earnings per share of $4.72, according to TipRanks — a slight drop from the $5.20 posted in the first quarter of last year. Still, those expectations may very well be conservative: Berkshire has a habit of beating estimates. Of course, the holding company is heavily influenced by swings in its massive stock portfolio — where Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC) are still key drivers, meaning soft numbers could bring Berkshire back down to Earth. Berkshire’s portfolio holdings also include shares of Amazon (AMZN), Coca-Cola (KO), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Citigroup (C), Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Chevron(CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Beyond the investment portfolio, Berkshire’s core operating businesses — which include Geico, BNSF Railway, and MidAmerican Energy — are expected to deliver solid results. (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom are also under Berkshire’s umbrella.) Insurance, in particular, has the potential be a bright spot if underwriting profits continue to recover after large catastrophe losses in recent years. Meanwhile, Berkshire is sitting on a record-breaking cash pile north of $300 billion. That’s partly a product of discipline: Buffett has steered clear of overpriced deals in a frothy market. But it also raises the pressure. Investors want to know if Berkshire sees any buying opportunities on the horizon — especially now that valuations in some sectors are coming back to earth. We already know a little bit about where Berkshire is investing: SEC filings show Buffett invested $54 million into Sirius XM (SIRI) in February and bought Verisign (VRSN) and Occidental Petroleum shares for close to a combined $40 million. Berkshire also purchased five add-ons to the Japanese trading houses for an estimated $2.7 billion. Berkshire also sold just under $148 million worth of DaVita (DVA) to maintain ownership below 45%. Because of market weakness, some analysts expect that Buffett will add to Berkshire’s already massive stack of Treasury bills. But there’s a subplot here: succession. Buffett is 94, and while he shows no sign of slowing down, vice chairman Greg Abel has been named as his eventual successor. Abel has been running the non-insurance businesses and is expected to play a prominent role at the annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha — which could be the most-watched company meeting in years. With investors increasingly focused on what Berkshire looks like after Buffett, the company’s earnings report — and what’s said during Saturday’s shareholder session — could offer clues about how the company will be managed going forward and what kind of moves are happening behind the scenes. How exactly does a company replace someone who is believed to be as close to a god as the industry has? Abel’s increased visibility will be both a reassurance and a test: Can Berkshire maintain its identity — and its top-tier reputation — in a post-Buffett world? Add in the broader market’s volatility and questions about where Berkshire might deploy its record cash reserves, and this quarter’s earnings could carry more weight than usual. The bottom line: Berkshire has been a market stalwart in 2025, but Saturday’s report will need to back that up with solid fundamentals — and maybe a few hints about what comes next.

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating on the top and bottom lines on better-than-anticipated iPhone sales. The company also authorized an additional $100 billion in stock buybacks. The announcement comes as consumer technology companies are contending with Trump's 145% tariff on goods from China. Apple's iPhones, iPads, and other computers, however, are exempt from the duties. Apple shares were down more than 1% on the news. Readmore here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Readmore here. The Nasdaq rose on Thursday as investors put aside uncertainty over President Trump's tariff policy and instead focused on optimism over Big Tech's AI prospects. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6% to extend its longest win streak of the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.5%, but off the highs of the session on the heels of better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META).

Investors awaited tech earnings fromApple(AAPL) andAmazon(AMZN) set to report right after the bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Amazon (AMZN) stock jumped 3% on Thursday ahead of its first quarter earnings report, where investors are expected to press the company on how upcoming tariffs might impact its business. For the quarter, Amazon is expected to see earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36 and revenue of $155.1 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. That’s a jump from the EPS of $0.98 and revenue of $143.3 billion the company reported in Q1 last year. Read more here.

But Eli Lily's CEO isn't as concerned. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports: Eli Lilly (LLY) has enjoyed a successful run the past several quarters as the company's blockbuster GLP-1 weight-loss drug Wegovy gains steam in the obesity space. But Wall Street wiped out more than $90 billion in the company's market cap during trading Thursday after competitor Novo Nordisk (NVO) locked in a deal to have its GLP-1 listed on CVS's (CVS) formularyas the preferred weight-loss drugfor patients. But Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks waved off the deal Thursday, telling Yahoo Finance in an interview that the company is focused more on upcoming obesity drugs in its pipeline and sees exclusive deals as an older way of doing business. ""We're not interested in exclusive deals. We think innovation and choice is very important. And we're well into the product replacement cycle, and there's more coming,"" Ricks said, referring to the highly anticipated oral form of Eli Lilly's GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to hit the markets mid-next year. ""It's in some ways a little disappointing to see this. It feels a little bit like last decade, these sort of lock-up deals,"" Ricks added. Read more here.

Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates fell this week amid a period of relative stability for the bond market. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.76% this week through Wednesday, from 6.81% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.92%, compared with 5.94% last week. After several weeks of volatility, 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, are starting to move lower once again. They’re around 4.2% as of Thursday morning, from 4.31% a week ago. Mortgage rates have been on a bumpy path since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs in early April, but they’re settling now as markets await more information about the likely path of benchmark interest rates. Read more here. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up as much as 2.4% on Thursday morning, and it is mainly megacap technology leading the index higher. Microsoft (MSFT) was up over 8% while Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) were both more than 4% higher. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock dropped more than 8% after the chipmaker gave a slightly softer-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Qualcomm said it expected $10.3 billion in revenue at the midpoint for the current period (its fiscal third quarter), slightlylower than the $10.33 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data. ""There's uncertainty around the impact of the global trade landscape on demand across our businesses,"" said CFO Akash Palkhiwala in a call with analysts. ""Our guidance for the upcoming quarter is based on our current assessment of the financial impact of tariffs as they stand today."" On the other hand, Qualcomm's earnings and revenue for the March period (its fiscal second quarter) beat expectations. Citi analyst Chris Danely removed the chipmaker from the investment firm's ""catalyst"" list for stocks to watch, as the analyst said a smartphone upgrade cycle is ""at least a year away."" Qualcomm's chips are used in Android cell phones and Apple (AAPL) iPhones. Qualcomm's drop comes as other chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) surged Thursday following Meta (META) and Microsoft's (MSFT) reaffirmation of their billions in spending on AI infrastructure this year. Qualcomm makes ASIC accelerators (custom chips to run AI models faster, used in addition to GPUs such as Nvidia's) for data centers. Manufacturing activity fell further into contraction in April as the reality of President Trump's tariffs set in. TheInstitute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMIfell to an index reading of 48.7 in April, below the 49 seen the month prior. However, the reading was above the 47.9 economists had expected. Readings below 50 indicate contraction in the sector. The ISM's prices paid index for the sector came in at 69.8, roughly flat compared to the prior month. Meanwhile, new orders increased to a reading of 47.2, above the 45.2 seen in March. ""In April, U.S. manufacturing activity slipped marginally further into contraction after expanding only marginally in February,"" chair of the Institute for Supply Management Timothy Fiore said in the release. ""Demand and output weakened while input strengthened further, conditions that are not considered positive for economic growth."" Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 4.3% early Thursday, leading chip stocks higher after Big Tech leaders Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) reaffirmed their aggressive AI investment plans. Shares of fellow AI chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Nvidia supplier Micron (MU), which makes advanced memory chips for its GPUs (graphics processing units), climbed 2.7%. During its quarterly earnings presentations late Wednesday afternoon, Microsoftreiterated its $80 billion spending plan to build out AI data centers, with more than half of that spending going toward the US. Meta, meanwhile, raised its capital expenditure outlook for 2025, forecasting spending will now fall between $64 billion and $72 billion, up from its prior range of $60 billion to $65 billion.

A US judge ordered Apple (AAPL) to immediately decrease its App Store fees and asked for criminal prosecutors to review the company's alleged ""cover-up,"" jeopardizing billions in revenue for the tech giant. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, in a blistering 80-page decision, said Apple circumvented her 2021 order that was first issued in an antitrustcasebrought by ""Fortnite"" developerEpic Games. Thatordersaid Apple must allow App Store developers to direct customers to app purchases outside the store. ""Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,"" wrote Gonzalez Rogers, a judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of California. She accused the tech giant's vice president of finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath during testimony before the court in February and referred the case to state criminal prosecutors to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings would be appropriate. Internally at Apple, the judge added, Apple fellow Phillip Schiller had advocated for Apple to comply with her 2021 injunction, but that was ignored by CEO Tim Cook. ""Cook chose poorly,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. Her mandate raises new questions about the financial impact on a major revenue stream for Apple as the tech giant prepares to report second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. The iPhone maker, which holds roughly19% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said in a court document that the App Store generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue. As of February 2025, the store hosted roughly 2 million downloadable apps. In 2024,accordingto Statista, the store earned nearly $92 billion globally, a 14% increase over 2023. The legal drama that unfolded this week started in August 2020, when Epic firstchallengedApple with a lawsuit. It was eventually decided in part in Apple's favor, finding that the company did not hold a monopoly in the market for ""digital mobile gaming transactions."" However, in a major victory for Epic — and app developers at large — the judge held that anti-steering provisions contained in the App Store's rules violated California's antitrust law. Essentially, Gonzalez Rogers' 2021 order said Apple must allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that can lead users to pay for in-app purchases outside the App Store. Epic and Apple appealed the decision to California's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed with Gonzalez Rogers that Apple had not violated federal antitrust laws. Although the court reached that conclusion for distinct reasons, it upheld the injunction in April 2023, holding that the anti-steering provisions violated California's Unfair Competition Law. The US Supreme Courtdeclined to reviewthe case in January 2024. Apple did make changes to its App Store rules following the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case, but Epic argued that the changes didn't comply with the order. Apple maintained its 30% commission and 15% commission for small businesses for in-app purchases, and it implemented a new 27% commission for off-app purchases, where it previously had not levied charges. According to the court, the company also introduced a ""scare screen"" to dissuade customers from leaving the App Store. Apple's goal, Gonzalez Rogers wrote, was to ""maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream"" and ""impose new barriers"" for developers. ""Apple, despite knowing its obligations ... thwarted the injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct...."" Gonzalez Rogers said. ""Remarkably, Apple believed that this court would not see through its obvious cover-up."" Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X@alexiskweed.

AAPL,2025-05-01,"Apple earnings updates: Wall Street watching for trade-war impact, iPhone production",Apple's earnings call is today at 5 pm ET. AAPL stock heads into the report down 15% YTD. Analysts are focused on tariff impact on supply chains.,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-stock-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2025-5,"Applereported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the closing bell, and it answered tariff questions with a nearly billion-dollar answer. The tech giant told investors on a call that Donald Trump's tariff plans could cost Apple $900 million in the current quarter. Analysts, however, had a lot of follow-up queries for CEO Tim Cook about which levies are and aren't included in the estimate. On Apple's supply chain, Cook said the company expects the ""majority"" of iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter to be made in India, marking a shift away from its main hub in China thanks to tariffs. Cook also fielded questions about Apple's progress on its Apple Intelligence software and a personalized Siri. Although its AI is available in more languages, Apple needs ""more time"" to perfect Siri. While revenue — including from iPhones — and EPS beat estimates, sales from its key Services unit and from Greater China disappointed. Apple's stockslid more than 4% in volatile after-hours trading after the results. The company reported revenue for the period of $95.36 billion, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $94.59 billion. But service revenue came in at $26.65 billion, missing the forecast of $26.72 billion. Shares rose 0.4% ahead of the close on Wednesday, bringing the stock's year-to-date loss to 15% at the close. Unlike other tech companies this spring, Apple was willing to say the word ""tariff"" during its analyst call today. And more than just that: The company was willing to spell out the financial effects the looming Trump tariffs will have on its business: It projects that they will add $900 million in costs in the June quarter. OK. But what exactly does that mean? I'm not 100% sure, and analysts also seemed unclear, and followed up with multiple questions for CEO Tim Cook. What Cookseemedto suggest is that Apple thinks the $900 million number holds if: Got it? OK. But what does that $900 million mean for Apple and its consumers? Would Apple consider eating those costs, or passing them along to consumers? Cook wouldn't answer that one directly. It is worth noting $900 million just isn't that much money for Apple, which generated $24.8 billion in profits this quarter. If Apple had to swallow that cost for many quarters to come, there's a good chance Wall Street would be okay with that. But at the same time, Cook stressed that the $900 million figure he's presented for the next quarter may not be applicable for future quarters, for a variety of reasons. Crystal clear, right? — Peter Kafka ""We've delivered a lot,"" Cook says when asked about the status of the features it teased at WWDC last year. Cook emphasizes, once again, Apple's recent rollout of Apple Intelligence in more languages. On the updated Siri, it needs ""more time."" — Jordan Hart Tim was asked about how product prices might be impacted by tariffs and Cook didn't give much away. He said ""we're very engaged on the tariff discussions."" He said the company ""will continue to engage on the pricing piece,"" but the company has nothing to add about how product prices might be impacted today. He added that the operational team ""has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain of the inventory."" — Jordan Hart ""We don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs,"" Cook says. He added that its channel inventory at the start of the quarter was similar to that of the end. — Jordan Hart Cook says he expects the ""majority"" of iPhones sold in the US during the June quarter to be made in India. Vietnam, he says, will be the country of origin for almost all of its other products coming into the US. The rest of the world still relies on China. — Jordan Hart Apple estimates that the current tariff rates will cost the company $900 million this current quarter if nothing changes. ""We are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter,"" it said. — Jordan Hart Cook says Apple is still getting the AI-powered Siri ready for iPhone owners. ""We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high quality bar,"" Cook says Cook shouts out Apple's four-year $500 billion spending plan partly for expanding its teams and facilities in Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and more. ""We expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year,"" Cook says. — Jordan Hart In its standard investor call blurb, the company said: ""Our discussion today will consist of forward looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook,including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measuresand macro economic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast."" Link hereif you want to listen along too. — Jordan Hart As Trump ups tariffs on China, some consumers chose to get ahead of potential price increases by upgrading their phones immediately. However, Wall Street still wants to know Cook's plan for a turbulent trade environment, tech analyst Jacob Bourne said. Cook is expected to shed light on how tariffs will affect consumers, and if the answer to its challenges lies in a manufacturing shift to India.""This balancing act comes during a crucial time as Apple prepares for WWDC and its next product cycle, where pricing strategy will be a focal point amid economic and supply chain uncertainty,"" Bourne said. — Jordan Hart Products revenue: $68.71 billion, +2.7% y/y, estimate $67.84 billion Source: Bloomberg Apple stock rose 0.4% ahead of its earnings release on Thursday after the closing bell. TheS&P 500closed 0.6% higher, while the tech-heavyNasdaq Compositerose 1.5%. Stocks werebroadly higheron Thursday after strong earnings results fromMetaand Microsoft. Jefferies said Apple was likely to beat the firm's revenue growth estimate of 0.9% for the first quarter. Still, analysts saw risks to Apple's profit margins, due to potential challenges the company may face as it looks to expand its iPhone production in India. ""This makes sense if we believe US reciprocal tariff on India will be very low, or AAPL gets an exemption. However, this may not be realistic,"" analysts said, pointing to ""more complicated assembly"" of some of Apple's newer and upcoming products. ""Therefore, we still see cost/margin risk at AAPL."" Jefferies rates Apple at ""Hold"" with a $167 price target, implying 22% downside from Wednesday's intraday high price. Federal judgeYvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Apple was in ""willful violation""of a 2021 ruling she had made, andthat she would refer the company for a possible criminal prosecution. That's pretty newsworthy. But what about the rest of Rogers' ruling? Well, that could be pretty newsworthy, too. It'spossiblethat this could finally be the thing that fundamentally changes the way Apple operates its App Store — an increasingly key source of the company's revenues. Or, it might not. Let's review. — Peter Kafka Looming tariff risks for Apple are likely going to drive investor questions around its massive exposure to China's manufacturing industry, according to Anurag Rana, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Apple's sourcing strategy will likely remain the most discussed topic on its 2Q earnings call given the company's high dependency on China for both assembly and components,"" Rana said in a note last week. Rana said that while Apple's products have been exempted from Trump's tariff list, there is still a risk that those surcharges return. Bank of America reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on Apple, citing the company's resilient earnings, stable cash flow, and potential benefit from incorporating AI on its devices. Still, the company's earnings estimates for the current quarter could take a ""more severe"" hit due to tariffs, particularly if tensions between the US and China escalate, BofA analysts wrote. ""However, we note that Apple has many options to mitigate downside risk to estimates. These include: sourcing more iPhones from India, applying higher pricing in products/services, pressuring its supply chain for better economics, introducing new products at higher price points and changing cadence of product releases,"" the bank added. Analysts issued a $250 price target for the stock, implying a 17% upside from current levels. As Apple's biggest revenue driver, iPhone sales have always taken center stage during Apple's earnings, and the flagship product will be even more in focus this time around. Investors will look for clues about the success of thecheaper iPhone 16e handsetreleased in February. They'll also look for indications from the company about the role of its AI-focused services, bundled up as Apple Intelligence, in spurring interest in new devices. Apple has also had a harder time getting new iPhones into pockets in its most important international market, China, as domestic players like Huawei have tried to entice consumers with advanced phones rivaling the iPhone with an aggressive pricing strategy. iPhone pricing is a key focus at a time when China tariffs have raised concerns among analysts thathigher costscould be passed on to consumers. — Hasan Chowdhury Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said a pull-forward i"

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’scloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA)reporteda solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadowWednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations.Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share.Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increaseon 27% revenue growth.

The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand.

Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’scloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA)reporteda solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb(ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadowWednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%.
