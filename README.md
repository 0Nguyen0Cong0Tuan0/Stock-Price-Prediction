# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data for tickers. The dataset includes stock prices, technical indicators, and sentiment scores, which are leveraged to perform advanced financial analyses such as trend forecasting, volatility studies, and sentiment impact assessment. The project employs a variety of machine learning and natural language processing models to derive insights from the data.

## Technologies and Models Used

This project utilizes a robust suite of models and technologies to analyze stock data, emphasizing both time series forecasting and sentiment analysis:
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Applied for time series forecasting of stock prices, capturing trends and seasonality in historical data.
- **Prophet**: Used for forecasting stock price trends, providing a flexible framework that handles missing data, trend changes, and seasonal patterns effectively.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Implemented for advanced time series forecasting, leveraging deep learning to model complex temporal dependencies in stock price movements.
- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**: Utilized for sentiment analysis of financial texts, focusing on capturing the sentiment intensity in news or social media data related to stocks.
- **FinBERT**: A BERT-based model fine-tuned for financial texts, employed to extract nuanced sentiment scores from financial news and reports, enhancing the sentiment analysis pipeline.
