The **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool designed to assess the sentiment expressed in text, particularly social media content.

Unlike ARIMA and Prophet, which are time series forecasting models focused on numerical data (e.g., demand forecasting), VADER analyzes textual data to quantify emotions, making it complementary for applications like demand forecasting when combined with external sentiment data (e.g., customer reviews impacting sales).

### **VADER model**

**Core concepts and algorithm**

VADER is a sentiment analysis tool optimized for short, informal texts (e.g., tweets, reviews) commonly found in social media. It combines a sentiment lexicon with heuristic rules to compute sentiment scores, balancing positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Unlike machine learning-based sentiment models, VADER is lightweight, interpretable, and requires no training, making it ideal for quick sentiment analysis.

**Mathematical representation**

VADER assigns a sentiment score to a text input based on:
- **Lexicon Scores** _ each word in the lexicon has a valence score (e.g., “happy” = +1.9, “sad” = -1.8) on a scale from -4 (extremely negative) to +4 (extremely positive).
- **Heuristic Rules** _ adjusts scores based on context (e.g., negation, emphasis, punctuation).

The output is a dictionary with four scores:
$$\text{Sentiment Scores} = \{ \text{neg}, \text{neu}, \text{pos}, \text{compound} \}$$
- **neg** _ Negative sentiment score (0 to 1).
- **neu** _ Neutral sentiment score (0 to 1).
- **pos** _ Positive sentiment score (0 to 1).
- **compound** _ Normalized score (-1 to +1), aggregating all sentiment contributions.

The compound score is computed as:

$$\text{compound} = \text{normalize} \left( \sum \text{valence\_scores} \cdot \text{modifiers} \right)$$

where:
- $\text{valence\_scores}$ _ sum of lexicon scores for words in the text.
- $\text{modifiers}$ _ adjustments from heuristic rules.
- $\text{normalize}$ _ scales the sum to [-1, 1] using $\text{normalize}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + \alpha}}$ with $\alpha = 15$ for stabilization.

**Heuristic Rules**

VADER applies five key rules to refine sentiment scores:
1. **Punctuation** _ exclamation points **(!)** or question marks **(?)** amplify intensity (e.g., *Great!!!* is more positive than *Great*).
2. **Capitalization** _ uppercase words increase intensity (e.g., *GREAT* > *great*).
3. **Degree Modifiers** _ words like *very* or *extremely* boost or dampen sentiment (e.g., *very good* > *good*).
4. **Negation** _ words like *not* or *never* reverse sentiment (e.g., *not good* becomes negative).
5. **Contrastive Conjunctions** _ *but* shifts emphasis to the latter clause (e.g., *It’s okay but amazing* emphasizes *amazing*).

###  **Algorithm Workflow**

1. **Text preprocessing**
- Tokenize text into words and punctuation.
- No heavy preprocessing (e.g., stemming) is needed, unlike some NLP models, as VADER preserves raw text nuances.

2. **Lexicon Lookup**
- Assign valence scores to words found in the VADER lexicon (approximately 7,500 words, emojis, and slang).

3. **Apply Heuristic Rules**
- Adjust scores based on punctuation, capitalization, modifiers, negation, and conjunctions.

4. **Score Aggregation**
- Compute raw sentiment sum, normalize to obtain the compound score, and calculate proportional scores (neg, neu, pos) summing to 1.

5. **Output**
- Return a dictionary with neg, neu, pos, and compound scores for interpretation.

**Comparison with ARIMA and Prophet**
- **Data Type** _ VADER processes textual data, while ARIMA and Prophet handle numerical time series (e.g., demand in tons).
- **Purpose** _ VADER quantifies sentiment, which can serve as an exogenous variable for ARIMA (ARIMAX) or Prophet (regressors) to enhance forecasting (e.g., sentiment-driven demand).
- **Complexity** _ VADER is simpler, requiring no training or tuning, unlike ARIMA’s statistical rigor (stationarity, ACF/PACF) or Prophet’s Bayesian fitting.
- **Interpretability** _ VADER’s compound score and component scores (neg, neu, pos) are intuitive, similar to Prophet’s component plots and ARIMA’s coefficients.

### **Applications of VADER**

VADER is widely used in sentiment analysis, particularly for social media and customer feedback, with potential integration into demand forecasting workflows like the food manufacturing case.

**Sentiment Analysis in Business**
- **Context** _ VADER can analyze customer reviews or social media posts about a food product to gauge public sentiment, which may influence demand. For the Moroccan food company, VADER could assess reviews to predict sales trends (e.g., positive sentiment boosting demand).
- **Outcomes** _ sentiment scores can inform marketing strategies, product improvements, or supply chain adjustments, complementing ARIMA/Prophet forecasts.
- **Example** _ analyzing tweets about a food product to detect sentiment shifts during holidays, aiding demand planning.

**Broader Applications**
- **Social Media Monitoring** _ tracking brand sentiment on platforms like Twitter or Reddit (e.g., detecting negative sentiment after a product recall).
- **Customer Feedback Analysis** _ evaluating reviews on e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon) to assess product satisfaction.
- **Market Research** _ measuring consumer sentiment toward competitors or industry trends.
- **Finance** _ analyzing news or social media sentiment to predict stock price movements, often combined with ARIMA or GARCH.
- **Healthcare** _ assessing patient feedback or public sentiment during health campaigns (e.g., vaccine sentiment).
- **Politics** _ monitoring public opinion during elections or policy changes.

**Integration with Demand Forecasting**
- **Exogenous Variable** _ VADER’s compound scores can be aggregated over time (e.g., monthly average sentiment) and used as a regressor in Prophet or ARIMAX to enhance demand forecasts, addressing ARIMA’s limitation of ignoring external factors.
- **Example** _ positive sentiment from reviews during a festive season could predict increased food demand.

**Comparison with ARIMA and Prophet**
- **Complementary Role** _ VADER provides sentiment insights that ARIMA and Prophet cannot, enabling hybrid models (e.g., Prophet with sentiment regressors) for the food manufacturing case.
- **Scope** _ VADER is not a forecasting model but a feature extractor, unlike ARIMA and Prophet’s predictive capabilities.
