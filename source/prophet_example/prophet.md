The **Prophet** model, developed by Meta AI (formerly Facebook AI), is a powerful and user-friendly time series forecasting tool designed for business applications with strong seasonal patterns, missing data and external influences.

Unlike **ARIMA** model, which relies on statistical assumptions like stationarity and linearity, Prophet adopts a decomposable additive model that combines trend, seasonality, holidays and optinal exogenous variables, making it more flexible for real-world datasets.

### **Prophet**

**Core concepts and algorithms**

Prophet is an additive regression model that decomposes a time series into trend, seasonality, holidays and error components. It is designed for daily, weekly or monthly data with robust handling of missing values, outliers and non-linear patterns, making it particularly suited for business forecasting tasks like demand prediction.

**Mathematical representation**

The Prophet model is expressed as:

$$y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \epsilon_t$$

where
- $y(t)$ _ the observed time series value at time $t$
- $g(t)$ _ trend component (non-linear, piecewise linear or logistic growth)
- $s(t)$ _ seasonality component (yearly, weekly, daily, modeled via Fourier series)
- $h(t)$ _ holiday component (effects of holidays or events)
- $\epsilon_t$ _ error term (assumed to follow a normal distribution)

**Trend component** $g(t)$

**Piecewise linear** _ Prophet models trends as piecewise linear functions with changepoints (points where the growth rate changes). Changepoints are automatically detected or manually specified.

**Logistic growth** _ For datasets with saturation (e.g., market capacity), a logistic growth model is used:

$$g(t) = \frac{C}{1 + e^{-k(t-m)}}$$

where
- $C$ _ the carrying capacity
- $k$ _ the growth rate
- $m$ _ the offset

**Flexibility** _ Unlike ARIMA's reliance on differencing for stationarity, Prophet's trend adapts to non-linear changes without preprocessing.

**Seasonality component** $s(t)$

Seasonality is modeled using Fourier series to capture periodic patterns:

$$s(t) = \sum^N_{n=1} \left[ a_n \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{P}\right) + b_n \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{P}\right) \right]$$

where
- $P$ _ the period (e.g., 365.25 for yearly seasonality)
- $N$ _ controls the complexity of the seasonal curve

Prophet supports multiple seasonalities (e.g., yearly, weekly), unlike ARIMA, which requires SARIMA for seasonality.

**Holiday component** $h(t)$

Holidays are modeled as additive effects with user-defined windows (e.g., +=3 days around a holiday). Each holiday $i$ contributes:

$$h(t) = \sum_{i \in \text{holidays}} κ_i \cdot 1(t \in D_i)$$

where
- $κ_i$ _ the holiday effect
- $D_i$ _ the holiday window

This is a key advantage over ARIMA, which can not directly model event-driven effects.

**Error term** ($\epsilon_t$)

Assumed to be normally distributed, similar to ARIMA's white noise assumption but Prophet is less sensitive to residual assumptions due to its Bayesian framework.

### **Algorithm workflow**

Prophet's workflow is simpler than ARIMA's Box-Jenkins methodology, prioritizing automation and ease of use:

1. **Data preparation**

- Input data as a DataFrame with 2 columns: `ds` (datetime) and `y` (numeric value).
- Handle missing values (Prophet interpolates automatically) and outliers (via robust fitting).

2. **Model specification**
- Define the trend type (linear or logistic), seasonality periods (e.g., yearly, weekly) and holidays (optional)
- Specify changepoint flexibility (e.g, `changepoint_prior_scale`) to control trend adaptability.

3. **Parameter estimation**
- Fit the model using a Bayesian framework (via Stan) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Parameters (e.g., trend slopes, Fourier coefficients) are optimized automatically.
- Unlike ARIMA's manual tuning of $p$, $d$, $q$, Prophet automates most parameter choices.

4. **Forecasting**
- Generate future predictions with confidence intervals (via Monte Carlo simulation)
- Output includes trend, seasonality and holiday components for interpretability.

5. **Diagnostics**
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation (e.g., rolling window forecasts) and metrics like MAE or MSE
- Visualize components plots (trend, seasonality, holidays) to understand contributions.

**Comparison with ARIMA**
- **Stationarity** _ Prophet does not require stationarity, unlike ARIMA, which uses differencing $d$ to achieve it. This makes Prophet more robust for non-stationary data.

- **Seasonality** _ Prophet natively handles multiple seasonality, while ARIMA requires SARIMA for seasonal patterns.

- **Ease of use** _ Prophet's automation reduces the need for manual tuning, unlike ARIMA's reliance in ACF/PACF and stationary tests

- **Exogenous variables** _ Prophet can include regressors (similar to ARIMAX) while ARIMA requires extensions like ARIMAX.

- **Interpretability** _Both are interpretable but Prophet's component decomposition (trend, seasonality, holidays) is more intuitive for business users than ARIMA's statistical parameters ($\phi, \theta$)

### **Applications of Prophet**

Prophet is widely used in business and operational forecasting, particularly where seasonality, holidays and missing data are prevalent. Its application aligns with the demand forecasting context.

**Demand Forecasting in Business**
- **Context** _ Prophet excels in forecasting demand for products or services with seasonal patterns (e.g., retail sales, food manufacturing demand). Prophet could model monthly demand, capturing yearly seasonality and holiday effects (e.g., Ramadan, if relevant)
- **Outcomes** _ Accurate forecasts optimize inventory, production planning and supply chain efficiency, reducing costs and stockouts, similar to ARIMA's benefits in the paper.
- **Example** _ Forecasting sales for a food product, Prophet could account for increased demand during festive seasons, unlike ARiMA's limitation to historical patterns.

**Broader applications**
- **Retail** _ predicting sales for e-commerce platforms, accounting for Black Friday, Christmas or regional holidays.
- **Energy** _ forecasting electricity consumption with daily and weekly patterns.
- **Web analytics** _ modeling website traffic with weekly and yearly trends (e.g., higher traffic on weekends).
- **Finance** _ predicting metrics like transaction volumes though less common than ARIMA due to Prophet's focus on seasonality over volatility.
- **Healthcare** _ forecasting patient admissions or disease incidence, handling irregular event-driven spikes (e.g., flu season).
- **Tourism** _ modeling hotel bookings or flight demand with seasonal and holiday effects.

### **Impact on related fields**

Prophet has significantly influenced time series forecasting, particularly in business analytics and data science:
