**FinBERT** is a specialized version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model, fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis. 

Available via the `transformers` library in Python (`from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification`), FinBERT is designed to analyze financial texts (e.g., news, earning calls, social media posts) and classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

Unlike VADER, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, FinBERT leverages deep learning to capture contextual nuances in text, making it more adept at handling complex financial language.

### **FinBERT model**

**Core concepts and algorithm**

FinBERT is a transformer-based model built on BERT, a bidirectional language model that processes text by considering context from both directions (left and right). Fine-tuned on financial datasets (e.g., Financial PhraseBank, earnings call transcripts), FinBERT excels at sentiment classification in financial contexts, outperforming rule-based models like VADER for domain-specific tasks.

**Mathematical representation**

FinBERT processes text through a series of transformer layers to produce a sentiment classification:
- **Input** _ text tokenized into subwords using a BERT tokenizer.
- **Embedding** _ tokens are converted into embeddings (word, position, and segment embeddings).
- **Transformer Layers** _ 12 layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks encode contextual representations.
- **Output** _ a classification head maps the [CLS] token’s representation to sentiment probabilities (positive, negative, neutral).

The sentiment output is a probability distribution over three classes:

$$P(\text{sentiment | text}) = \text{softmax}(W \cdot h_{[CLS]} + b)$$

where:
- $h_{[CLS]}$ _ final hidden state of the [CLS] token.
- $W, b$ _ parameters of the classification head.
- $\text{softmax}$ _ converts logits to probabilities $P(\text{positive})$, $P(\text{negative})$, $P(\text{neural})$

### **Algorithm workflow**

1. **Text preprocessing**
- Tokenize text using `BertTokenizer`, splitting into subwords and adding special tokens ([CLS], [SEP]).
- Convert tokens to input IDs, attention masks, and token type IDs, padded/truncated to a fixed length (e.g., 128 tokens).

2. **Model inference**
- Pass input through `BertForSequenceClassification`, which outputs logits for positive, negative, and neutral classes.
- Apply softmax to obtain probability scores.

3. **Sentiment classification**
- Select the class with the highest probability or use probabilities for weighted analysis.
- Optionally, map probabilities to a numerical score (e.g., positive: +1, neutral: 0, negative: -1) for time series integration.

4. **Aggregation (for time series)**
- Aggregate sentiment scores over time (e.g., monthly averages) for use in forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet.

**Comparison with VADER**
- **Data Type** _ FinBERT and VADER process textual data.
- **Approach** _ FinBERT uses deep learning, capturing context better than VADER’s lexicon and rules.
- **Complexity** _ FinBERT requires GPU/CPU resources and model loading, unlike VADER’s lightweight rules.
- **Output** _ FinBERT provides class probabilities, while VADER outputs compound and component scores. 

### **Applications of FinBERT**

FinBERT is tailored for financial sentiment analysis but can be adapted to other domains, including enhancing demand forecasting in contexts like the food manufacturing case.

**Sentiment Analysis in Finance**
- **Context** _ FinBERT analyzes financial news, earnings calls, or social media posts to gauge sentiment about a company or product, which may influence demand. For the Moroccan food company, FinBERT could assess news articles about the brand to predict sales impacts (e.g., positive news boosting demand).
- **Outcomes** _ sentiment scores inform investment decisions, marketing strategies, or supply chain adjustments, complementing ARIMA/Prophet forecasts.
- **Example** _ analyzing news headlines about a food product recall to detect negative sentiment, aiding inventory planning.

**Broader Applications**
- **Stock market prediction** _ correlating sentiment from news or tweets with stock price movements, often combined with ARIMA or GARCH.
- **Corporate strategy** _  evaluating sentiment in earnings calls to assess management confidence or market perception.
- **Consumer sentiment** _ analyzing reviews or social media for non-financial products (e.g., food, retail), extending FinBERT’s domain.
- **Risk management** _  detecting negative sentiment in financial reports to *anticipate risks*.
- **Market research** _ measuring sentiment toward competitors or industry trends.

**Integration with demand forecasting**
- **Exogenous variable** _ FinBERT’s sentiment probabilities (e.g., monthly average positive probability) can be used as a regressor in Prophet or ARIMAX.
- **Example** _ positive news about a food product’s quality could predict increased demand, improving forecast accuracy.

**Comparison with VADER**
- **Financial focus** _ FinBERT’s fine-tuning for financial texts outperforms VADER’s general-purpose lexicon in domain-specific tasks.
- **Complementary role** _ like VADER, FinBERT provides sentiment features for ARIMA/Prophet, addressing ARIMA’s limitation of ignoring external factors.
- **Food manufacturing** _ FinBERT could analyze financial news about the food industry, complementing VADER’s customer review analysis.

### **Impact on related fields**

FinBERT has influenced natural language processing (NLP) and financial analytics:
- **Financial Analytics** _ FinBERT’s ability to extract nuanced sentiment from financial texts supports algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and corporate strategy.
- **NLP** _ as a fine-tuned BERT variant, FinBERT demonstrates the power of domain-specific pretraining, inspiring models like BioBERT or LegalBERT.
- **Data science** _ Integrated into the `transformers` library, FinBERT is widely used in Python pipelines, similar to VADER’s `vaderSentiment`, Prophet’s `prophet`, and ARIMA’s `statsmodels`.
- **Interdisciplinary applications** _ FinBERT’s sentiment scores enhance forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) by providing financial sentiment as an exogenous variable, bridging NLP and time series analysis.
- **Business intelligence** _ enables real-time sentiment monitoring, aligning with the paper’s supply chain optimization goals.

**Comparison with VADER**
- **Domain specificity** _ FinBERT’s financial focus contrasts with VADER’s social media optimization.
- **Impact** _ FinBERT advances financial NLP, while VADER democratizes sentiment analysis.
